        "chunk_text": "Biology, as you discovered last year, is the study of living organisms. Now, at the beginning of your grade 10 biology course, you are going to be studying biotechnology. Biotechnology is the use of micro-organisms to make things that people want, often involving industrial production. Biotechnology has always been extremely important. It involves ways of making and preserving foods and making alcoholic drinks. Traditional applications of biotechnology involve brewing beers, making wines, making bread, and making cheese and yoghurt. Modern applications of biotechnology include using genetic engineering to change crops and animals; producing new medicines; and helping to provide new energy sources. It has enormous significance in helping people to improve and control their lives. Biotechnology is based on microbiology. As you know, microbiology is the study of micro-organisms \u2013 tiny living organisms including bacteria, viruses, fungi and protoctista, which are usually too small to be seen with the naked eye. Some micro-organisms cause disease; others are enormously useful to people \u2013 for example, they play a vital role in decay and the recycling of nutrients in the environment. With the arrival of new technologies such as genetic engineering, micro-organisms are becoming more useful all the time. Not all types of micro-organism are used in biotechnology. The main groups are bacteria and fungi, although viruses are being used more and more for genetic engineering. Just to remind you \u2013 bacteria are single-celled organisms that are much smaller than the smallest plant and animal cells. In ideal conditions, they can reproduce very quickly. Viruses are even smaller than bacteria. They do not carry out any of the normal functions of living things. Moulds and yeasts are both fungi \u2013 living organisms which obtain their food from other dead or living organisms. Yeasts are single-celled organisms, while moulds are made up of thin, thread-like structures called hyphae. Developing new applications of biotechnology is one of the fastest-growing industries around the world, and is beginning to grow in Ethiopia too. It is easy to think that biotechnology is very new, but much of it has been in use for thousands of years. People have used micro-organisms to make food and drink almost as far back as our records go. Bacteria are used in the manufacture of irgo (yoghurt) and Ayib (cheese). Yeast is used to make many traditional Ethiopian fermented foods, including injera, and also to produce alcoholic drinks, such as tej and tella. One of the most useful micro-organisms is yeast. The yeasts are single-celled organisms. Each yeast cell has a nucleus, cytoplasm and a membrane surrounded by a cell wall. The main way in which yeasts reproduce is by asexual budding \u2013 splitting into two, to form new yeast cells. Just one gram of yeast contains about 25 billion cells! When yeasts have plenty of oxygen, they respire aerobically, breaking down sugar to provide energy for the cells, and producing water and carbon dioxide as waste products. But yeasts are useful because they can also respire anaerobically. When yeast cells break down sugar in the absence of oxygen, they produce ethanol (commonly referred to as alcohol) and carbon dioxide. Aerobic respiration provides more energy than anaerobic respiration, allowing yeast cells to grow and reproduce. However, once they exist in large numbers, yeast cells can survive for a long time in low-oxygen conditions, and will break down all the available sugar to produce ethanol. The anaerobic respiration of yeast is sometimes referred to as fermentation. We have used yeast for making bread and alcoholic drinks almost as far back as human records go. We know yeast was used to make bread in Egypt in 4000 BC, and some ancient wine found in Iran dates back to 5400\u20135000 BC. Here in Ethiopia yeast (known locally as ershoo) has been used to make injera (bread) possibly since even earlier times. Injera needs yeast When you make injera, grind your teff or barley and then add water. Mix it well and leave the dough at room temperature for about two days. Natural yeasts start to grow and respire in the dough. At first the yeast respires aerobically, although this may change to anaerobic respiration. The yeast produces carbon dioxide, making the mix rise a little and giving it a tangy flavour. When you cook the mixture, the bubbles of gas expand in the high temperature, giving injera its typical texture, which is so good for soaking up the food. The yeasts are killed during the cooking process.",

        "chunk_text": "When fruits fall to the ground and begin to decay, wild yeasts on their skin break down the fruit sugar to form ethanol and carbon dioxide. These fermented fruits can cause animals to become drunk when they eat them \u2013 and this is probably how our ancestors discovered alcohol! We now use this same reaction in a controlled way to make drinks such as beer, tej and wine. In both cases the yeast has to be supplied with carbohydrates to act as an energy source for respiration. Tej is one of the oldest drinks known to the human race \u2013 it has been known since at least 400 BC. When you make tej, you need honey, water and gesho leaf or gesho stick. Gesho gives a bitter edge to the brew, and wild yeasts found on the plant start the fermentation going. The yeasts use the honey as a source of food. As the yeast colonies grow they start to respire anaerobically, and this produces ethanol and carbon dioxide. The alcohol content of tej varies from about 6 to 11%. Tej and tella are the most commonly consumed alcoholic drinks in Ethiopia. In contrast, winemaking uses natural sugar, found in fruit such as grapes, as the energy source for the yeast. You press the fruit and mix the juice with yeast and water. You then let the yeast respire anaerobically until most of the sugar has been used up. At this stage, you filter the wine to remove the yeast and put it in bottles, where it will remain for some time to mature before it is sold. Most commercially sold wine is made from grapes, but wine can be made from almost any fruit or vegetable \u2013 the yeast doesn\u2019t care where the sugar it uses comes from! Interestingly, alcohol in large amounts is poisonous to yeast as well as to people. This is why the alcohol content of wine is rarely more than 14% \u2013 once it gets much higher, it kills all the yeast and stops the fermentation. Remember: yeast can respire aerobically in bread making, but must respire anaerobically to make alcoholic drinks.",

It didn\u2019t take people long to discover ways of changing milk, turning it into milk-based foods with a much longer life than the original milk. These changes depend on the action of micro-organisms. Yoghurt has long been a staple part of the diet in the Middle East and Africa including Ethiopia.

        "chunk_text": "Traditionally, yoghurt is fermented whole milk. Yoghurt is formed by the action of bacteria on the lactose (milk sugar) in the milk. To make yoghurt, you add a starter culture of the right kind of bacteria to warm milk. Often this starter culture is just a small amount of yoghurt you have already made. The mixture needs to be warm so the bacteria begin to grow, reproduce and ferment. As the bacteria break down the lactose in the milk, they produce lactic acid, which gives the yoghurt its sharp, tangy taste. This is known as lactic fermentation. The lactic acid produced by the bacteria causes the milk to clot and solidify into yoghurt. The action of the bacteria also gives the yoghurt a smooth, thick texture. Once the yoghurt-forming bacteria have worked on the milk, they also help prevent the growth of other bacteria that normally send the milk bad. Yoghurt, if it is kept cool, will last almost three weeks before it goes bad. Ordinary milk lasts only a few days \u2013 and then only if it\u2019s kept really cold. Once you have made your basic yoghurt, you can mix in flavourings, spices and fruit. In Ethiopia, we often make yoghurt (irgo) in gourds or hollowed-out wooden vessels that have had sticks burned in them. These sticks are obtained from different plants such as the olive tree, and so on. As well as giving the yoghurt a pleasant flavour, this disinfects the vessel so that only good bacteria grow in the milk.",

        "chunk_text": "Like yoghurt making, cheese making depends on the reactions of bacteria with milk changing the texture and taste, and also preserving the milk. Cheese making is very successful in preserving milk, and some cheeses can survive for years without decay. Around 900 different types of cheese are made around the world, but the basis of the production method is the same for them all. Just as in yoghurt making, you add a starter culture of bacteria to warm milk. The difference is in the type of bacteria added. The bacteria in cheese making also convert lactose to lactic acid, but they make much more lactic acid. As a result, the solid part (curds) is much more solid than in yoghurt. Enzymes are also added to increase the separation of the milk. These often come from the stomachs of calves or other young animals. When it has completely curdled, you can separate the curds from the liquid whey (known as aguat here in Ethiopia). Then you can use the curds for cheese making. The whey is often used in other dishes. The curds can be used fresh, and can be seasoned or flavoured. This is the basis of ayib. Alternatively, you can cut and mix the curds with salt along with other bacteria or even moulds, before you press them and leave them to dry out. The bacteria and moulds added at this stage of the process are very important. They affect the development of the final flavour and texture of the cheese as it ripens \u2013 a process that may take months or years, depending on the type of cheese being made. This is how the majority of cheeses are made in countries such as the UK and the USA. Here in Ethiopia cheese is traditionally made by first making yoghurt from fresh milk, extracting the butter by continuous agitation, and finally boiling the remaining part to make the cheese.",

So, for example, a gene from one of your human cells can be \u2018cut out\u2019 using enzymes, and transferred to the cell of a bacterium. Your gene carries on making a human protein, even though it is now in a bacterium. There is a limit to the types of protein that bacteria are capable of making. Scientists have found that genes from one organism can be transferred to the cells of another type of animal or plant at an early stage of their development. As the animal or plant grows, it develops with the new, desired characteristics from the other organism.",

        "chunk_text": "For many years, we have used selective breeding to change our livestock and crops. We select animals or plants with characteristics we want, such as big grains, resistance to disease or plenty of milk, and breed from them. Gradually, the characteristics change to what we want. But selective breeding takes time, and there are limitations to it. You will be looking at this in more detail in the next unit. By using genetic engineering, we can introduce new characteristics very rapidly. Engineered genes can be used to improve the growth rates of plants and animals. They can be used to improve the food value of crops. Genetic engineering has been used to make crop plants that are resistant to drought and to disease, and to produce plants that make their own pesticide chemicals. Glowing genes from jellyfish have even been used to produce crop plants that give off a blue light when they are attacked by insects so the farmer knows they need spraying! This means the farmer has to use less insecticide (chemicals that kill insects), which saves money and protects the environment. Much of the research into genetically engineered crops and animals has been carried out in countries like the UK and the USA. However, here in Ethiopia our scientists are increasingly working with these new technologies. At the Ethiopian Institute of Agricultural Research and Addis Ababa University, scientists are analysing the genes of many of our most important crop plants, including teff. The Ethiopian Agricultural Research Institute is using modern biotechnology to improve teff, coffee, fruit plants and some of our forest trees for commercial cultivation. However, there are some possible problems with the new biotechnologies, so we must be careful. Insects may become pesticide-resistant if they eat a constant diet of pesticide-forming plants. Genes from genetically modified plants and animals might spread into the wildlife of the countryside, which could make difficulties. Genetically modified crops are often not fertile, which means farmers have to buy new seed each year. But if these problems can be overcome, biotechnology offers us the hope of better crops and more food, both for our own people and to sell internationally.",

One of the biggest changes is that enzymes are produced by genetically engineered bacteria, and the enzymes are then used in the production of processed foods and drinks. Enzymes are used to clarify beer. They are used to break down starch and convert the sugars into glucose syrup. They are used to make meat more tender, and to break down the food used to make commercial baby food. Biotechnology plays a big part in food production. It has even been used to create a completely new food based on fungi, which has been developed in the UK. It is known as mycoprotein, which means \u2018protein from fungus\u2019. It is produced using the fungus Fusarium, which grows and reproduces rapidly on a relatively cheap sugar syrup in large, specialised fermenters. It needs aerobic conditions to grow successfully, and can then double its mass every five hours or so. The fungal biomass is harvested and purified. Then it is dried and processed to make mycoprotein, a pale yellow solid with a faint taste of mushrooms. On its own, it has very little flavour, but mycoprotein can be given a range of tastes and flavours to make it similar to a whole range of familiar foods. It is a high-protein, low-fat meat substitute used by vegetarians, people who want to reduce the fat in their diet, and people who just want to eat cheap protein. When mycoprotein was first developed, people thought a world food shortage was on its way. They were looking for new ways to make protein cheaply and efficiently. The food shortage never happened, but the fungus-based food continued. It is versatile, high in protein and fibre, and low in fat and calories, and so has found a secure and healthy place on the meal tables of the developed world. Scientists in Ethiopia and elsewhere are trying to develop a local equivalent of mycoprotein, looking at different plants and fungi that have a relatively high protein content.",

        "chunk_text": "Biotechnology is extremely important in modern medicine. It is used to develop vaccines and to create new medicines. The first medicine that really relied on microbiology was penicillin. This antibiotic is one of the best-known medicines in the world, and has revolutionised medicine in the time since it was first manufactured. We are going to look more closely at this story because it shows clearly how changes in biotechnology make life easier. In 1928 Alexander Fleming, a young researcher at St Mary\u2019s Hospital in the UK, left some plates on which he was culturing bacteria uncovered near an open window. When he remembered to look at them, he found bacteria were growing on the surface of his dishes, as he expected. But Fleming also noticed spots of mould growing, and around these were clear areas of agar. The bacteria were no longer growing there. Whatever had blown in through the window and started growing on his plates was producing a chemical that killed the bacteria. Fleming found that the micro-organism which had invaded his Petri dishes was a common mould called Penicillium notatum. He managed to extract a tiny amount of the chemical that killed the bacteria, and used it to treat an infected wound. He called his extract penicillin. But it was very hard to extract, and very unstable once extracted, so Fleming decided he wouldn\u2019t be able to obtain useful amounts of penicillin from his mould. Howard Florey and Ernst Chain were working at Oxford University in the UK in a desperate search to find a drug to kill the bacteria that infected wounds suffered by soldiers in the Second World War. They used Fleming\u2019s mould and finally managed to extract enough penicillin to show what it could do. They wanted to manufacture it in large amounts, but the yield of drug was very poor. Fleming\u2019s original mould, Penicillium notatum, was extremely difficult to grow in large cultures, yielding only one part penicillin for every million parts of fermentation broth. Then a mould growing on a melon in a market was found to yield 200 times more penicillin than the original. What is more, it grew relatively easily in deep tanks, making large-scale production possible. By 1945, enough penicillin was made each year to treat seven million people. Modern strains of Penicillium mould give even higher yields. We grow the mould in a sterilised medium, containing sugar, amino acids, mineral salts and other nutrients, which is made from soaking corn in water. It is grown in huge 10 000 dm3 fermenters, and still saves many thousands of lives every year. When genetically engineered bacteria are cultured on a large scale, they can make huge quantities of protein. We now use them to make a number of drugs and hormones used as medicines. These genetically engineered bacteria make exactly the protein needed, in exactly the amounts needed, and in a very pure form. For example, people with diabetes need supplies of the hormone insulin. It used to be extracted from the pancreas of pigs and cattle, but it wasn\u2019t quite the same as human insulin, and the supply was quite variable. Both problems have now been solved by the introduction of genetically engineered bacteria that can make human insulin. Biotechnology also makes it possible to develop vaccines more easily. A number of sheep and other mammals have been engineered to produce life-saving human proteins in their milk. These are much more complex proteins than those produced by bacteria, and have the potential to save many lives. For example, genetically modified sheep can make special blood-clotting proteins in their milk. These can be used for people with haemophilia, so they are no longer at risk from receiving contaminated blood.",

        "chunk_text": "Biogas is a flammable mixture of gases, formed when bacteria break down plant material, or the waste products of animals, in anaerobic conditions. It is mainly methane, but the composition of the mixture varies depending on what is put into the generator and which bacteria are present. Around the world, millions of tonnes of faeces and urine are produced by animals like cows, pigs, sheep and chickens. We produce our fair share of waste materials too! Also, in many parts of the world, plant material grows very rapidly. Both the plant material and the animal waste make up a potentially enormous energy resource \u2013 but how can we use it? To produce biogas, you collect dung or plant material, which contains a high level of carbohydrates, and put it into a biogas generator or digester. Then you add a mixed population of many different types of bacteria which are needed to digest the carbohydrate. The bacteria you use are similar to those in the stomachs of ruminants such as cows or sheep. Some of the bacteria break down the cellulose in plant cell walls. Others break down the sugars formed, to produce methane and other gases. The biogas produced is passed along a pipe into your home, where you burn it to produce heat, light or refrigeration. The bacteria involved in biogas production work best at a temperature of around 30 \u00b0C, so biogas generators tend to work best in hot countries. However, the process generates heat (the reactions are exothermic). This means that if you put some heat energy in at the beginning to start things off, and have your generator well insulated to prevent heat loss, biogas generators will work anywhere. Some generators are so simple, they are little more than a big plastic bag and some pipes. Yet they can make a big difference to our lives.",

What you put into your small generator has a big effect on what comes out. Biogas units are widely used in China, where there are well over 7 million biogas units, producing as much energy as 22 million tonnes of coal. Waste vegetables, animal dung and human waste are the main raw materials. These Chinese digesters produce excellent fertiliser, but relatively low-quality biogas. In India, there are religious and social taboos against using human waste in biodigesters. As a result, only cattle and buffalo dung is put into the biogas generators. This produces very high-quality gas, but much less fertiliser. There are also different sizes and designs of biogas generator. The type chosen will depend on local conditions. For example, many fermenters are sunk into the ground, which provides very good insulation. Others are built above ground, which may be easier and cheaper, but offers less insulation. If night-time temperatures fall too low, it could cause problems. Many countries are now looking at biogas generators, and experimenting with using them on a larger scale. The waste material we produce from sugar factories, sewage farms and rubbish tips all has the potential to act as a starting point for the production of biogas. We have some problems to overcome with scaling the process up, but the early progress looks promising. Biogas could well be an important fuel for the future for all of us. It would help us to get rid of much of the waste we produce, as well as providing a clean and renewable energy supply.",

It is much less polluting than conventional fuels, which produce carbon monoxide, sulphur dioxide and nitrogen oxides. In addition, you can mix ethanol with conventional petrol to make a fuel known as gasohol. This is increasingly being done, and reduces pollution levels considerably, although there is still some pollution from the petrol part of the mix. Using ethanol as a fuel is a carbon-neutral activity. This means there is no overall increase in carbon dioxide in the atmosphere when you burn ethanol. The original plants removed carbon dioxide from the air during photosynthesis. When you burn the ethanol, you simply return it. The biggest difficulty with using plant-based fuels for our cars is that it takes a lot of plant material to produce the ethanol. As a result, the use of ethanol as a fuel has largely been limited to countries with enough space, and a suitable climate, to grow a lot of plant material as quickly as possible. Here in Ethiopia, we have that capability. The main problem for many countries is finding enough ethanol. If people in Europe added 5% ethanol to their fuel, it would reduce carbon dioxide emissions \u2013 but they would need 7.5 billion litres of ethanol a year, which they cannot produce themselves. The methods of ethanol production we use at the moment leave large quantities of unused cellulose from the plant material. To make ethanol production work financially in the long term, we need to find a way to use this cellulose. We might develop biogas generators, which can break down the excess cellulose into methane, another useful fuel. Genetically engineered bacteria or enzymes may be able to break down the cellulose in straw and hay and make it available for yeast to make more ethanol. We don\u2019t know exactly what the future will hold, but it seems likely that ethanol-based fuel mixes will be part of it. Here in Ethiopia the Ministry of Mines and Energy has already started mixing ethanol with petrol to provide fuel for cars. Along with the production of biodiesel from plants such as castor oil beans and jatropha, which grows in dry climatic conditions that do not suit crop production, Ethiopia is making great strides in the use of biofuels. As long as we maintain a balance between the use of land to provide food and the use of land to provide us with fuel, the use of biotechnology in this way has great potential for us in the future.",

Each gene is a small section of DNA. Life as we know it depends on the properties of this complicated chemical, so it seems amazing to think we have only understood it for about 50 years! \u2022 A gene is a unit of hereditary material located on the chromosomes. DNA is a long molecule, made up of two strands twisted together to make a spiral known as a double helix \u2013 imagine a ladder that has been twisted round. The big DNA molecule is actually made up of lots of smaller molecules (nucleotides) joined together. A nucleotide consists of a phosphate group, a sugar and a base. In DNA there are four different bases that appear time after time in different orders, but always paired up in the same way. The bases link the two strands of the DNA molecule together. Genes are made up of repeating patterns of bases in the DNA. (See page 22.) By the 1940s, most scientists had decided that DNA was probably the molecule that carried inherited information from one generation to the next. But how did it work? Repeating patterns of 4 different bases make up the structure of the DNA molecule By the 1950s, two teams in the UK were getting close to understanding the structure of this amazing molecule. Maurice Wilkins and Rosalind Franklin in London were taking special X-ray photographs of DNA and looking at the patterns in the X-rays in the hope that they would show them the structure of the molecule. At the same time, James Watson (a young American) and Francis Crick (from the UK) were working on the DNA problem at Cambridge. They took all the information they could find on DNA \u2013 including the X-ray crystallography from London \u2013 and kept trying to build a model of the molecule that would explain everything they knew. When they finally realised that the bases always paired up in the same way, they had cracked the code. The now famous double helix was seen for the first time. Watson, Crick and Wilkins all received the Nobel Prize for their work. Rosalind Franklin died of cancer before the prizes were awarded. Since the structure of DNA was revealed, there has been an enormous explosion in the amount of research done on genetics. We now know that the bases that make up DNA are called adenine, thymine, guanine and cytosine. The two DNA strands are linked by these bases, where adenine pairs with thymine and cytosine pairs with guanine. The upright strands are made of deoxyribose sugar and phosphate. Each base, sugar and phosphate together form a nucleotide. DNA is therefore a polynucleotide chain. The genes found on the chromosomes control everything that goes on in your cells by organising all the proteins that are made. As you learned in grade 9, a protein is a long chain of amino acids. Different combinations of amino acids can be joined together to make different proteins. So the order of the bases in the DNA acts as a code to instruct the cell about the order in which to join up the amino acids to make a particular protein. This is how the genes control what goes on in the cells and in the whole organism. The Human Genome Project has been a massive international effort by scientists from many countries who set out to read the DNA of the entire human genome. This work is showing us exactly what genes we all have in common, and which characteristics they code for.",

However, the new cells that are produced must contain the same genetic information as the originals, so that they can do the same job. In animals and plants that have asexual reproduction it is necessary for one cell to split into two genetically identical cells for the organism to reproduce. Body cells (also known as somatic cells) divide to make new cells. The cell division that takes place in the normal body cells and produces identical cells is known as mitosis. As a result of mitosis, every body cell has the same genetic information. In asexual reproduction, the cells of the offspring are produced by mitosis from the cells of their parent.

        "chunk_text": "Before a cell divides, it produces new copies of the homologous pairs of chromosomes in the nucleus. Each chromosome forms two identical chromatids. Then the chromatids divide into two identical packages, and the rest of the cytoplasm divides as well to form two genetically identical daughter cells. Once the new cells have formed, the chromatids are again referred to as chromosomes. The daughter cells each have exactly the same number of chromosomes as the original cell. To make it easier to understand what is going on, we divide this process into stages \u2013 interphase, prophase, metaphase, anaphase and telophase (figure 2.5) \u2013 but in fact mitosis is one continuous process. In some areas of the body of an animal or plant, cell division like this carries on rapidly all the time. Your skin is a good example \u2013 thousands of cells are constantly being lost from the surface, and new cells are constantly being formed by cell division to replace them. As food passes along your gut (grade 9 biology), cells are scraped off the gut lining. Fortunately, there is a layer of cells underneath that is constantly dividing by mitosis to replace those that are lost. Most of the time, you can\u2019t see the chromosomes in the nucleus of a cell, even under the microscope. However, when a cell is splitting in two, the chromosomes become much shorter and denser, and will take up special colours called stains. At this stage you can see them under the microscope. The name \u2018chromosome\u2019 means \u2018coloured body\u2019, referring to what the chromosomes look like when they have taken up the stain.",

The length of the cell cycle varies considerably. It can take less than 24 hours, or it can take several years, depending on which cells are involved and at which stage of life. There are many cycles during the years of growth and development, but it slows down once puberty is over in the adult. Mitosis is taking place all the time in tissues all over your body.

The female gametes, or ova, are made in the ovaries; the male gametes, or sperm, are made in the testes. In plants, the sex cells are the pollen and the ovules. The cells in the reproductive organs (also known as germ cells) divide to make sex cells. The cell division that takes place in the reproductive organ cells and produces gametes is known as meiosis. Meiosis is a special form of cell division where the chromosome number is reduced by half. When a cell divides to form gametes, the chromosomes are copied so there are four sets of chromatids. The cell then divides to form two identical daughter cells. These cells then divide again immediately, without the chromatids doubling again, in the second meiotic division. This forms four gametes, each with a single set of chromosomes. The details of this process are shown in figures 2.8 and 2.9. As in mitosis, the process is shown as being broken up into different stages, but in real life it is a single, flowing process that has been described, rather poetically, as the \u2018dance of the chromosomes\u2019. \u2022 Meiosis is the division of the sex cells resulting in daughter cells with half the original number of chromosomes. Why is meiosis so important? Your normal body cells have 46 chromosomes in two matching sets, 23 from your mother and 23 from your father. If two body cells joined together in sexual reproduction, the new cell would have 92 chromosomes, which simply wouldn\u2019t work. As a result of meiosis, your sex cells contain only one set of chromosomes, exactly half the full chromosome number. So when the gametes join together at fertilisation, the new cell that is formed contains the normal number of 46 chromosomes.",

Mendel was born into a very poor family but he was very clever. The only way in those days for a poor person to get an education was to join the church. Mendel became a monk at a monastery in Brunn in Austria, and he became fascinated by the breeding patterns of the peas in the monastery gardens. He carefully bred different pure strains of peas \u2013 round peas, wrinkled peas, green peas, yellow peas \u2013 and then carried out breeding experiments with them.",

Mendel opened the bud of his pea flowers before the pollen matured. He fertilised the stigma by brushing it with ripe pollen from another chosen flower. In this way he could control the cross. Mendel used seven clearly different, pure-breeding traits of the pea plant for his experiments. They are shown here in both their dominant and recessive forms. You will learn what these terms mean later in this chapter. Mendel developed a theory to explain his observations, based on independent particles of hereditary material, some of which were dominant over others but never mixed together. The abbot of the monastery supported his work and built him a large greenhouse in which to carry it out. Mendel observed, for example, that the round shape of peas seemed to dominate the wrinkled shape, but that the information for a wrinkled shape continued to be carried and could emerge again in later generations \u2013 in other words there were unique units of inheritance that were not blended together. Mendel kept precise records of everything he did, and made a statistical analysis of his results \u2013 something almost unheard of in those times. Finally in 1866, when he was 44 years old, Mendel published his findings; they explained some of the basic laws of genetics in a way we still refer to today. Sadly no one listened to Mendel. He was ahead of his time. Nobody yet knew of the existence of chromosomes, let alone genes, so there was no model to help people understand Mendel\u2019s new ideas. He died nearly 20 years later with his ideas still ignored \u2013 but still sure that he was right. Sixteen years after his death, Gregor Mendel\u2019s work was finally recognised. By 1900 people had seen chromosomes through a microscope. Three scientists, Hugo de Vries, Eric von Seysenegg and Karl Correns, discovered Mendel\u2019s papers and duplicated his experiments. When they published their results, they gave Mendel the credit for what they observed. From then on ideas about genetics developed fast \u2013 it was suggested that Mendel\u2019s units of inheritance might be carried on the chromosomes seen beneath the microscope, and the science of genetics as we know it today was born.",

The chromosomes we inherit carry our genetic information in the form of genes. Many of these genes have different forms, known as alleles. A gene can be pictured as a position on a chromosome. An allele is the particular form of information in that position on an individual chromosome for example, the gene for dimples may have the dimple or the no-dimple allele in place. Most of your characteristics, like your eye colour and nose shape, are controlled by a number of genes. However, some characteristics like dimples and having attached earlobes are controlled by a single gene. Often there are only two possible alleles for a particular feature, but sometimes you can inherit one from a number of different possibilities. When we are trying to understand genetics, we tend to stick to traits that are controlled by a single pair of genes, because they are much simpler. Characteristics that are inherited through different forms of a single gene are examples of monohybrid inheritance. Almost every example you consider in this book will be a case of monohybrid inheritance. There are genes that decide whether: \u2022 your earlobes are attached closely to the side of your head or hang freely \u2022 your thumb is straight or curved \u2022 you have dimples when you smile \u2022 you have hair on the second segment of your ring finger We can use these genes to help us understand how inheritance works.",

Some alleles control the development of a characteristic only if they are present on both chromosomes \u2013 in other words, no dominant allele is present. These alleles are recessive. The gene that controls dimples has two possible forms \u2013 an allele for dimples, and an allele for no dimples. The gene for dangly earlobes also has two possible alleles \u2013 one for dangly earlobes and one for earlobes that are attached. You will get a random mixture of alleles from your parents \u2013 which is why you don\u2019t look exactly like either of them.

If you put your hand in and \u2013 without looking \u2013 picked out one bead from the father bag and one bead from the mother bag, what pairs might you get? If the bags contained only red beads or only blue beads, the pairs would all be the same. But if each bag held a mixture of red and blue beads you could end up with three possible pairs \u2013 two blue beads, two red beads or one of each. This represents the random way in which you may inherit different genes from your parents, depending on the different alleles they have. For example, if both of your parents have two alleles for dimples (like the red beads) you will definitely inherit two dimple alleles \u2013 and you will have dimples! If both of your parents have two alleles for no dimples, you will inherit alleles for no dimples and you will be dimple-free. But if your parents both have one allele for dimples and one for no dimples, you could end up with two dimple alleles, two no dimple alleles \u2013 or one of each! If you happen to inherit one of each type of dimple allele, how does your body know whether to produce dimples or not? The allele for dimples is dominant so it will always be seen over the allele for no dimples. If you get one of each type of allele, you will have dimples. What\u2019s more, if you have brothers and sisters, they could inherit a different combination to you, and so have different characteristics.

You are going to be looking at inheritance of different forms of one gene at a time. This is called monohybrid inheritance. Mendel started all his crosses using homozygotes because they are true breeding. This means that if you cross two individuals who are homozygous for the same characteristic, all of the offspring of all the generations that follow will have the same characteristic \u2013 unless a change in the DNA takes place. Heterozygotes are not true breeding. If you cross two heterozygotes, then the offspring may include a mixture of genotypes and phenotypes as you will see. Look back to figure 2.11. We are going to look at a cross between a pea plant which is homozygous for the dominant round pea shape, and a pea plant which is homozygous for the recessive wrinkled pea. The first generation of any cross is called the F1 (first filial generation) and you can see in figure 2.11 that they all have the same heterozygous genotype for the characteristic. They also all have the same phenotype \u2013 the round pea shape \u2013 because the round allele is dominant. There is no sign of the wrinkled pea allele. If we then cross members of the F1 generation we call the next generation the F2 (second filial generation). You can see in figure 2.11 that Mendel\u2019s theory predicts that the genotypes will be one homozygous round pea, two heterozygous round peas and one homozygous wrinkled pea. The recessive trait for the wrinkled pea has become visible again, after being \u2018hidden\u2019 in the F1 generation. Genetic crosses can be shown with the use of simple genetic diagrams called Punnett squares like those shown below.

If the feature is inherited through recessive genes then what you see is what you get. However, if the required feature is inherited through a dominant gene the physical appearance does not show whether the organism is homo- or heterozygous. To find out the genotype of an individual showing the effect of a dominant allele it must be crossed with a homozygous recessive individual. Because the recessive genes have no effect on the phenotype of the offspring unless they are in the homozygous state, this type of cross can reveal the required parental genotype (see figure 2.17). It is known as a test cross. For example, the colour of the pea seed is inherited as a dominant allele Y for yellow seeds or a recessive allele y for green seeds. Thus a plant producing yellow seeds could have the genotype YY or Yy. The phenotypic ratios of the progeny of the test cross reveal whether the yellow parent was homo- or heterozygous.",

Take an example.\nOne family has a herd of goats which give good milk yields, but do\nnot cope well without shade. Another family has goats which give\nless milk but are very hardy and resistant to the heat of the sun. If\nboth families selected their best male and female goats, and cross-\nbred them, some of the offspring would inherit both the genes for\ngood milk production and the genes for heat resistance. By selecting\nthe offspring carefully and breeding again and again, eventually a\nnew, true breeding type of goat would emerge.\nHowever, this is a long process \u2013 look back to section 2.2 and you\nwill see that F1 generations do not breed true. It takes a lot of\nwork to develop a new true breeding strain. Farmers often simply\ncontinue to cross-breed to get the benefits of each F1 generation.\nSo perhaps they will have a good bull from one breed and let him\nservice their cows from another breed, so that the calves all have the\ncombination of characteristics that is desired.\nAround the world, a combination of selective breeding and cross-\nbreeding has produced cattle which come in an enormous range of\nshapes and sizes, as you can see in figure 2.25. We must be careful with our breeding programmes, however.\nThe Belgian Blue cattle which you can see in figure 2.25 have\n\u2018double muscles\u2019, which means they produce a very large amount\nof low-fat meat. However, the calves are often so big that the\ncows cannot deliver them and they have to be born surgically, by\nCaesarean section. Some European countries want to ban this breed\ncompletely.",

        "chunk_text": "Once a stimulus is picked up by a sensory receptor, the information is passed along special nerve cells, affector or afferent neurons, to the central nervous system (CNS), made up of your brain and spinal cord. Once the information has been processed in the CNS, instructions are sent out to the body along more neurons called effector or efferent neurons. These stimulate the effector organ, usually muscles or a gland. sense organ \u2192 afferent neuron \u2192 central nervous system \u2192 efferent neurons \u2192 muscles These neurons are the basic unit of your nervous system, with millions of them working together in your body. Neurons are extremely specialised for the transmission of electrical impulses. They have a cell body that contains the cell nucleus, mitochondria, and other organelles. They also have slender finger-like processes called dendrites that connect to neighbouring nerve cells. The most distinctive feature of all nerve cells is the axon or nerve fibre, which is extremely long and thin. The nerve impulse travels along the axon from one place to another (see figure 3.2). Neurons are also irritable \u2013 which means they react to the world around them \u2013 and they can conduct electricity. This is the result of the structure of the axon. The axon membrane changes its permeability to sodium ions to create an electrical impulse (see the action potential below), while the myelin sheath provides a layer of insulating material so the nerve impulse travels as fast as possible. So, to recap, afferent neurons carry information from your receptors to your central nervous system (CNS). In the brain the information is added to the vast amounts of other information arriving from all over the body. The brain co-ordinates all this information and then sends messages out along efferent neurons. These effector neurons carry messages from the CNS to different parts of the body to make muscles contract and/or organs respond to the changes in the surroundings. The huge network of nerves running all over your body carrying information to and from the CNS is called your peripheral nervous system. The muscles or organs of the body that bring about the response to the original stimulus are known as effectors. Nerves are bundles of neurons. Some carry only effector neurons and are known as effector nerves, some carry only affector neurons and are known as affector nerves, whilst others carry a mixture of effector and affector neurons and are called mixed nerves. Your nervous system relies on nerve impulses travelling along the neurons. Each nerve impulse is a minute electrical event that is the result of charge differences across the membrane of the axon. The wave of positive charge inside the axon when the neuron is stimulated is known as the action potential. Neurons are not continuous \u2018wires\u2019 running about your body. Whenever one neuron ends and another begins there is a gap known as a synapse. The electrical impulses that travel along your neurons have to cross these synapses, but an electrical impulse cannot leap the gap. So when an impulse arrives at the end of a neuron, chemicals are released. These chemical transmitters (neurotransmitters) cross the synapse and are picked up by special receptor cells in the end of the next neuron. In turn this starts up an electrical impulse, which then travels along your next neuron. This is how impulses pass from one neuron to another all over your body. Every neuron \u2013 and particularly the neurons in your brain \u2013 will have thousands of synapses, each one connecting it to other neurons. So synapses are very important for the co-ordination of information in your central nervous system, information that is coming in from many different areas of your body. There are special synapses between effector neurons and the muscles they stimulate. These are known as neuromuscular junctions and they work in the same way as a normal synapse, except the chemical crossing the gap causes the muscles to contract. The chemical transmitters produced by different cells are not always the same. Sometimes one neurotransmitter will cancel out another. Some medicines \u2013 and some poisons \u2013 work by blocking chemical transmission across a synapse or by speeding it up.",

        "chunk_text": "You have seen how the neurons carry messages around the body in the form of electrical impulses, and have considered the sense organs that respond to changes in both your internal and external environments. But the affector inputs and the impulses are no use without some sort of co-ordination \u2013 and this is where the central nervous system comes into its own. The central nervous system consists of two main regions \u2013 the brain and the spinal cord. Your brain is a delicate mass of nervous tissue with the consistency of thick yoghurt. It is enclosed in membranes and protected by the bones of your skull in a space known as the cranium. The spinal cord runs out from your brain down your body. It is encased and protected by the vertebrae making up your spine. As you have seen, the nerves that run to and from the CNS make up your peripheral nervous system. The nerves that come out of the brain are known as the cranial nerves. They go mainly to structures in your head and neck, like your eyes, tongue and jaws. The majority of the nerves come out of the spinal cord and these are known as the spinal nerves. They go to the arms, the legs and the trunk (the rest of your body). Your brain is a very complex structure that carries out an amazing variety of functions. The different areas of the brain carry out very different functions, from the basic reflexes that keep us breathing to the complex ideas needed to create a story or write and play music. Our understanding of how the brain works is based partly on observations of people who have suffered injuries to different areas of the brain through accidents or disease. The impact of damage in a certain area on abilities to speak and think can give us clear clues as to the working of the brain. More recently, new technology has enabled us to see inside the living brain \u2013 but we still have a lot to learn about how this most complex organ works. The bulk of your brain is made up of grey matter \u2013 the cell bodies of neurons and the synapses that connect them. Inside the brain is white matter \u2013 the axons that lead into and out of the brain. As an embryo develops in the womb, the brain starts off as a tube in the head with three main areas. The fore brain develops into the olfactory lobes, which deal with smell, and the cerebral hemispheres that are involved in all the higher levels of thought. Some areas of the cerebrum (cerebral hemispheres) are involved in the co-ordination and interpretation of affector input from your sense organs. Other areas are involved in sending out effector impulses to control the actions of your body in response to the affector information. The mid brain develops into the areas of your brain that deal with vision (the optic lobes) while the hind brain forms the areas of the brain that deal with balance and orientation (the cerebellum) and the most fundamental reflexes of life (the medulla). Even if all of your higher brain is damaged and destroyed, you may continue to breathe if your medulla is intact. The spinal cord has a much simpler structure than your brain. The grey matter (cell bodies and short relay neurons) are in the middle and the white matter (axons) are on the outside. At regular intervals along the spinal cord there are entrance points for affector nerves bringing information into the CNS and exit points for effector nerves carrying instructions from the CNS. The way in which the human brain works to make each of us who we are is still not understood very well. So it is perhaps not surprising that we don\u2019t fully understand what happens when things go wrong. Sometimes the processes in the brain don\u2019t work as they should. Mental illness is a very general term that is difficult to define. It is the term we use to describe a wide variety of disorders and diseases, which are diagnosed as mental illnesses because they involve thought processes, emotional disturbances and/or behaviour that are considered abnormal. Mental illness may range from mild depression, when someone feels low and sad for no apparent reason and cannot lift their mood, to conditions such as psychosis, when your ability to distinguish between what is real and what is imaginary becomes seriously affected in a way that can completely take over your life. Mental illness can be the result of an imbalance of the chemical transmitters in your brain, and so for some conditions there are effective treatments. However, scientists and doctors have a great deal of research to do before all of these conditions are fully understood and can be treated. One growing concern is that the use of illegal drugs, which affect the chemistry of the brain, is leading to an increase in mental illness in young people. You will look at the effect of drugs in more detail on pages 64\u201374.",

However, a change in a sense organ alone is simply not enough. The information needs to reach your central nervous system and you need to process the information and then respond. Many of the activities you carry out are voluntary \u2013 you choose to do them. So how do they come about? For example, if you see a mango or a banana that looks ripe on a market stall, you may well pick it up, feel it and smell it before deciding if it is as good as it looks and buying it. \u2022 When you see the mango the information from your eyes travels along affector neurons to your spinal cord. \u2022 From the spinal synapses the electrical signal continues up affector neurons in the spinal cord until it reaches the brain. \u2022 The information is assimilated along with other information that places you in a market and links into memories of buying unripe or over-ripe mangos in the past as well, and the pleasure of a ripe mango. \u2022 Electrical messages are sent back along from the brain along the effector nerves down your spinal cord. \u2022 At more spinal synapses the message is transferred to effector nerves running to the muscles of your arm and hand that enable you to make a voluntary movement, reaching out to take hold of the mango, feel it and bring it to your nose to smell it. \u2022 Another flood of information from stretch receptors in your muscles, olfactory (smell) receptors in your nose, pressure receptors in your skin and many more goes back to your brain, all in a very short space of time, to be processed again before you make your next voluntary movement. Think of a different situation \u2013 crossing a road, greeting a friend, eating a meal \u2013 and work out what is happening in your nervous system. To summarise the situation, the nervous system is involved in rapid responses by the human body to changes in the world around it and within the body as well. Receptor cells collect information about a particular stimulus and electrical impulses transmit the information from the receptor cells along affector neurons to the central nervous system (CNS). Here the information is processed and another electrical impulse is sent out along the effector nerves to a muscle or gland (effector) that will then cause the appropriate body response. Muscles contract whilst glands release chemical substances. In a normal conscious action we are in control \u2013 we see a book, reach out and pick it up or hear an approaching car and stop moving. But some of the actions of our body are so rapid that there is no time for conscious thought. Others take place without any awareness on our part \u2013 when was the last time you realised your pancreas was producing insulin or that your gastric pits were filling up with digestive enzymes? So what is happening in these involuntary or reflex actions?",

        "chunk_text": "Some of our responses to stimuli are purely automatic. When we touch something very hot we withdraw our hand before we are consciously aware of the sensation of pain. If an object approaches our face we blink. We breathe and the muscles of our gut churn our food. Reactions such as these are known as reflexes. Reflexes occur very fast. They are usually involved in helping us to avoid danger or damage. We also have lots of reflexes taking care of basic bodily functions, leaving the brain free for thinking about other things. Breathing is a good example. You don\u2019t consciously instruct your diaphragm to flatten and your intercostal muscles to contract yet your breathing movements continue, because breathing is a reflex action. Not only does gaseous exchange take place constantly, but you don\u2019t have to waste precious thinking time making sure it keeps going. The pupil reflex, where the pupil of your eye dilates or constricts depending on the light levels, is another example of a protective reflex action that you don\u2019t have to think about. It protects your retina from damage from too much light, and enables you to see as well as possible in low light levels. The blink reflex, where you blink your eyes if something comes towards your face, protects your eyes from physical damage. The key point about a reflex action is that the messages do not reach a conscious area of your brain before instructions are sent out to take action. Many reflexes involve the spinal cord while others involve the brain. They involve three types of neuron \u2013 affector neurons, relay neurons and effector neurons. Relay neurons connect the affector and effector neurons directly in the CNS, without input from other areas. The receptors, neurons and effectors involved are referred to as a reflex arc. The brain and spinal cord together act as co-ordinators that process the information coming from sensory receptors and neurons and instruct effector neurons and effectors to react. A reflex action is a sudden, automatic and uncontrolled response of parts of the body or the whole body to external stimuli. The reflex jerk of your knee is used by doctors to check that your reflexes are working properly \u2013 but it normally works if you stumble and the tendon is stretched. The reflex helps to straighten your leg and stop you falling.",

The effector neuron leaves the spinal cord by the ventral root. In this example the impulses arrive in the muscles of the upper arm, causing them to contract and move your hand upwards sharply. Most reflex actions can be analysed as follows: stimulus \u2192 receptor \u2192 afferent neuron \u2192 co-ordinator \u2192 efferent neuron \u2192 effector \u2192 response This is very similar to a normal conscious action, except that in a reflex the co-ordinator is a relay neuron either in the spinal cord or in the unconscious areas of the brain.

However, even as the impulse is moving through the reflex arc, other neurons have also been stimulated at the synapses in the CNS and these carry information up to the conscious brain so that you know what has happened after the event.",

        "chunk_text": "However, not all reflexes are simple. Some of them can be learnt. In 1902, a Russian scientist called Ivan Pavlov investigated conditioned reflex action using a dog. He noticed that a dog produces a lot of saliva at the sight of food. The production of saliva is a reflex action in response to the sight of food. In this experiment, a bell was rung every time food was supplied to a dog. After the experiment was repeated several times he noticed that when the bell was rung the dogs salivated, even if there was no food present. Usually the sound of a bell does not cause a dog to salivate. In the experiment, however, the dog had learnt to associate the sound of the bell with the presence of food. Thus, the sound of the bell started the secretion of saliva in the same way as the sight of food. Salivation at the sound of the bell thus became a reflex action. Since this reflex action was not innate (there at birth), it is a result of experience or learning. This learned reflex action is called a conditioned reflex action. It is possible to change an animal\u2019s behaviour in this way. This helps an animal to learn new ways of behaving. Conditioned reflexes also produce responses which are favourable. For example, a child is usually attracted to anything that moves, especially animals. This is an automatic behaviour. If, however, a safari ant happens to bite the child it is almost certain that in future, instead of being attracted to it, the child will fear to move towards a safari ant. Thus the child\u2019s behaviour has been changed or conditioned. So reflexes are important both for keeping us safe, and for helping us to learn.",

Most of you will have had a cup of coffee at some point in your lives \u2013 and so you have taken caffeine, a legal stimulant drug! What do we mean by a drug? A drug is a substance which alters the way in which your mind, or body, or both, works. In every society there are certain drugs which are used for medicine and others which are used for pleasure. Usually some of these substances are socially acceptable and others are illegal. In Ethiopia caffeine, nicotine, khat and alcohol are the legal recreational drugs. The status of a drug may be related to its effect on people, or it may be simply down to the history of its use. Most of the drugs which we use for medicine affect our bodies. The drugs we use for pleasure tend to have a distinct effect on our minds. Drug (or substance) use is when you choose to take a substance that affects your brain and/or body function and mental activity. It is done for a variety of reasons. Legal drugs are used for the mild pleasure they bring, to be sociable and because using them becomes a habit. People start to use illegal drugs for much the same reasons \u2013 because everyone else does and because you like the effect \u2013 but as many of these drugs are highly addictive, they can soon lead to many problems. Drug (or substance) abuse is when you use a substance to the point of excess and/or dependence. When you take an excess of a drug you risk serious side effects and even death. Drug dependence is when you use a drug again and again and become addicted. Drugs change the chemical processes in your body and this is why you can become addicted to them (dependent on them). If you are addicted to a drug you cannot manage or function properly without it. This may be psychological \u2013 the need to keep using it becomes a craving or compulsion. On the other hand it may be a physical dependence where your body no longer works properly without added chemical extras. Once addicted to a drug, you cannot manage without it and you generally need more and more of it to keep you feeling normal. When an addict tries to stop using their drug they will feel very unwell, often experiencing combinations of aches and pains, shaking, sweating, headaches, cravings for the drug and even fevers as the body reacts \u2013 these are known as withdrawal symptoms. Drug abuse, of both legal and illegal substances, is becoming more of a public health problem in Ethiopia because the numbers of people involved is growing. School surveys have shown that alcohol, khat, tobacco, cannabis (marijuana) and solvents are the substances most widely used in Ethiopia. Alcohol, khat and tobacco are legal drugs in Ethiopia \u2013 you can buy them easily in shops and bars, but cannabis is illegal. Solvents like gasoline are legal but are not meant for humans to inhale. Drugs such as LSD, ecstasy, cocaine and heroin are illegal but rarely used in Ethiopia. Khat, alcohol and tobacco are linked to a wide range of health problems. The health issues linked to these legal drugs are mainly the result of their effect on the systems of your body. However, illegal drugs also affect the health, in two quite different ways. Firstly, like any other drug, they cause changes in your body and can damage vital systems. But also, because these drugs are both illegal and addictive, people need to find considerable sums of money to feed their addiction. They may spend all of their cash on drugs, not feed themselves properly because they are buying drugs with the money, turn to crime or prostitution to raise the money they need and take part in risky activities such as sharing needles, which increases the risk of becoming infected with HIV/AIDS or hepatitis. So the lifestyle associated with illegal drug use also has a major impact on health. However, these behaviours are relatively rare in Ethiopia, as you will see. In the next part of this chapter you are going to look at some of the most commonly used recreational drugs in Ethiopia. They all have the following features in common: \u2022 They are addictive. \u2022 They affect brain function and alter behaviour. \u2022 They damage health, resulting in lower productivity and absence from school/work. \u2022 They adversely affect the individual, families, community and country.

However, the evidence suggests that more and more young people are taking up smoking across the whole of Africa. The addictive drug in cigarette smoke is nicotine, which affects the brain and produces a sensation of calm well-being and being able to cope. However, it is very physically addictive. Unfortunately cigarette smoke also contains many very harmful chemicals, and these are linked to a number of very serious health conditions. Smoking increases your risk of the following diseases: \u2022 Coronary Heart Disease \u2013 the chemicals in the tobacco smoke affect the walls of your arteries. They make the blood vessels supplying oxygen to the heart narrow. This reduces the blood supply to the heart and other areas of the body. They also tend to damage the smooth lining of the arteries, which makes it much more likely that atherosclerosis will occur. \u2022 Strokes \u2013 the blood vessels taking blood to the brain suffer the same damage as the vessels going to the heart described above. If the blood vessels going to the brain become blocked you suffer a stroke. An area of your brain is damaged which may lead to paralysis, memory loss and even death. \u2022 Lung Disease \u2013 tar and other chemicals in tobacco smoke damage the tissues of the lungs and lead to a greatly increased risk of developing chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and lung cancer. \u2022 Cancers (lip, mouth, throat, pancreas, bladder and kidney) \u2013 many of the chemicals in cigarette smoke are carcinogenic (cancer causing) and smoking has been shown to increase the risk of all these listed cancers. The mouth, lips and throat are obvious, but no one is quite sure exactly why the pancreas, bladder and kidney are particularly affected by cigarette smoke. In recent years scientists have realised that smoking does not just affect the person who smokes. Passive smoking (inhaling smoke from those around you) can be equally dangerous to your health, and smoking while pregnant has been shown to affect the unborn child. Because nicotine is so addictive it can be very difficult to give up smoking once you have started. You have to break the addiction. There are a number of ways which people use \u2013 some more successful than others! Will power and determination are needed whichever method you chose. Some people rely on this alone. Others give up smoking but use nicotine patches or gum to help wean themselves gradually off the drug. At least then they are not taking in all the chemicals from the cigarette smoke and get used to being without a cigarette in their hands or mouth. Other people cut down on their cigarettes gradually, cutting out one or two at a time until they can give up entirely. Each individual has to find their own way to give up! It is easier not to start smoking at all!",

        "chunk_text": "Alcohol is poisonous. However, your liver can usually break it down. It gets rid of the alcohol before it causes permanent damage and death. Alcohol acts quickly because it is readily absorbed into the bloodstream from the stomach. When you have an alcoholic drink, the alcohol passes through the wall of your gut and goes into your bloodstream. From your blood, the alcohol passes easily into nearly every tissue of your body. It dilates blood capillaries near the skin surface producing a feeling of warmth and well-being. It increases the heart rate as well as increases hunger. It gets into your nervous system and brain. This slows down your reactions. It can make you lose your self-control. It contributes to poor muscular co-ordination, resulting in slurred speech and a lack of balance. Alcohol is a diuretic, which means that it makes you lose water through increased urination. As the effects of the alcohol wear off, it can cause headaches, due to dehydration, and nausea. When you have had too much to drink, you lack judgement. Research has shown that young people who drink alcohol are more likely to have unprotected sex. This means they are more likely to become pregnant, and also much more likely to become infected with HIV/AIDS. Young people who drink every day are three times more likely to have unprotected sex than those who do not drink. Alcohol can cause you to make stupid or dangerous decisions, decisions you might regret for the rest of your life. And if you drink large amounts of alcohol, like a whole bottle of spirits, your liver simply cannot cope. You suffer from alcohol poisoning. This can quickly lead to unconsciousness, coma and death. Some people drink heavily for many years, becoming alcoholics. They are addicted to the drug. Their liver and brain suffer long-term damage and eventually the drink may kill them. They may develop cirrhosis of the liver. This disease destroys your liver tissue. They can also get liver cancer, which spreads quickly and can be fatal. In some heavy drinkers their brain is so damaged (it becomes soft and pulpy) that it can\u2019t work any longer. This causes death. Short bouts of very heavy drinking can cause the same symptoms to develop quite quickly.",

As car ownership increases in Ethiopia, so do the number of deaths and injuries in car accidents. We need to make sure that people are aware of the dangers of drinking and driving. For example, alcohol is a factor in a high percentage of all fatal road accidents in the Caribbean. In fact, a survey in Trinidad a number of years ago showed that almost 50% of the men admitted to hospital had alcohol-related conditions. Let us make sure that here in Ethiopia we avoid these problems from the start! Alcohol abuse affects personal lives as well. Domestic violence is often linked to patterns of heavy drinking. Many crimes take place when people are under the influence of alcohol, often mixed with other drugs. Binge drinking is a recent problem. This often involves young people. They go out and get very drunk several nights a week. They can become violent and abusive, damage property and put their own health at risk both in cars and from HIV/AIDS through unprotected sex.",

        "chunk_text": "Khat is the le9a.3v%es of the khat shrub. People chew fresh khat leaves which contain a drug which affects the brain. It can also be made into a tea. It is a mild stimulant, makes people feel happy and also reduces your appetite. It is often used in social situations. In Ethiopia, khat use is growing fast among young people. It is a legal drug in our country. A survey showed that over 30% of our population use khat regularly. The drug cathinone from the khat leaves is absorbed into the bloodstream through the membranes lining the mouth and the stomach as the leaves are chewed. It acts quickly, within 30 minutes of starting to chew, before it is broken down and removed by the liver. People can become addicted to khat, and when they cannot get the drug feel depressed, tired and unable to concentrate. Surveys have shown that young people who are in school are much less likely to use khat than young people who are not in education. Khat use is linked to unprotected sex, putting young people at risk of pregnancy and HIV/AIDS infection. Young men who use khat have been shown to be more likely to use a sex worker, and more likely to have many different sexual partners. All of these behaviours increase their risk of becoming infected with HIV/AIDS and of passing that infection on to someone else. Using khat also makes people more likely to be injured in accidents, more likely to be involved in crime, less likely to have a job and more likely to have problems in their family lives. Khat has been a part of our Ethiopian culture for centuries, but now there are growing concerns about its use. It is an important part of our economy \u2013 in 1999\u20132000 sales of khat brought around $60 million into the economy. Khat is relatively easy to grow and it creates jobs in the harvesting, packing and transporting of it as well as in selling it. What is more, it stops you feeling hungry. If people have little food to eat, it helps them to cope if they can chew leaves which make them feel good and stop them feeling hungry. But the negative effects of the drug may be damaging the economy even more. People spend hours chewing and dreaming when they could be working. If people spent less time chewing khat and more time cultivating the fields there might be more food to eat. Khat affects the health of the population directly and indirectly by the behaviour it causes. For many young people, khat is destroying their chances in life. Many people in Ethiopia need to work together to find the best way to deal with the problem of khat. It might seem impossible, but in the UK 50 years ago smoking was widespread. Hundreds of thousands died from smoking-related diseases. Some people still smoke in the UK, but numbers have fallen dramatically and it is now against the law to smoke in public buildings. The numbers of people dying from smoking-related diseases has fallen steadily. This shows that it is possible to reduce the use of familiar local drugs. The final commonly used drug in Ethiopia is cannabis, also known by many other names including marijuana, ganja and weed.",

Using drugs reduces your ability to concentrate, to pay attention and to think logically and clearly; your judgement is impaired, which results in poor decision making. People often suffer from insomnia, anxiety, depression and acute panic reactions. These reactions inevitably affect other people as well. People who are experiencing paranoia and hallucinations are not easy to live with! Drug users often become suspicious of others, which can lead them into arguments and fights. Some drugs lead to an increase in appetite and weight gain, others to lack of appetite and weight loss. All these changes have a big impact on work as well as social and family life. Many drug users turn to crime to fund their drug habit. Often this involves prostitution, so drug users are particularly prone to sexually transmitted diseases including HIV/AIDS. The lifestyle linked to drugs often leads users to neglect their personal hygiene and fail to feed themselves properly. They often suffer ill health as a result. Drug users who inject themselves often share needles, which leads to a greatly increased risk of catching blood-borne diseases such as hepatitis and HIV/AIDS.

Many drug users crave attention and affection, often leading to an increasingly promiscuous lifestyle. Divorce is often the outcome of continued drug use. Some people use drugs to help them cope with problems in their family. But often, it is drug use that causes a family to break up under the strain. People who become long-term, regular drug users often become isolated from their families and community. This isolation can make it harder for friends and family to keep in touch with the drug user to encourage them to break the habit. The family of the drug abuser can often feel defeated, helpless and hopeless; they can experience a range of emotions such as anger, depression, fear, aggression, loneliness, hostility and embarrassment. This in turn affects the other relationships in the family. The family is often divided on how to address the problem and how to relate to the drug user, which creates its own conflict within the family. In many cases in order to maintain their habit, drug users will steal and sell items from home, creating further distress to the family. Even where the drug abuser is not in the family home there is the emotional and psychological pain from being uncertain of his or her whereabouts and state.

        "chunk_text": "You are going to look in detail at one of our most important sense organs \u2013 the eye. Although the detailed anatomy of your other sense organs is very different, the same basic principles for transferring energy apply. Sight is an important sense for human beings. The reason we can see so well is largely due to the very complicated sense organs that we use to pick up light stimulation \u2013 our eyes. A sensory organ is an organ that contains a large number of sensory receptor cells and the human eye is a good example. Our eyes enable us to see in clear focus, in three dimensions and in colour. Not many other animals can manage all three. Let\u2019s take a look at the structure of the human eye and find out exactly how it works. Your eyes are set in eye sockets in your skull that protect them. You also have eyelids that close over your eyes to protect them from the entry of material like dust, sand and insects, which might injure or irritate them. The eyelids also sweep tear solution regularly over the surface of your eye, which contains enzymes that destroy bacteria that might infect your eye. The white outer layer of the eye, the sclera, is very tough and strong so the eyeball is not easy to damage. It has a transparent area at the front known as the cornea, which lets light into the eye. The cornea is also very important for bending the light coming into the eye to make sure it enters the eye and is focused on the retina. The rest of the sclera has many blood vessels, which supply your retina with food and oxygen, and a dark layer underneath \u2013 the choroid. This layer is dark because it contains pigmented cells that absorb light and stop it being reflected around the inside of the eye. Your eyeball is filled with a jelly-like fluid that helps to hold its shape. Once the light has travelled through the cornea it has to pass through the pupil in the centre of the iris. The iris is the coloured part of the eye, but it is not there simply to look pretty. It is made up of muscles that contract or relax to control the size of the pupil and so to control the amount of light reaching the retina. The circular muscles run around the iris, while the radial muscles run across it like the spokes of a bicycle wheel. When the light is relatively dim, the radial muscles contract and the circular muscles relax and the pupil is pulled open wide (it dilates). When the pupil is dilated, lots of light can get into the eye and so you can see even in relatively low light levels. In bright light, however, the circular muscles of the iris contract and the radial muscles relax, which makes the pupil very small (it constricts). This reduces the amount of light that goes into the eye, so that the delicate light-sensitive cells are not damaged by too much bright light. The change in the size of the pupil in response to light is a reflex action \u2013 you don\u2019t have to think about it. You have already learnt about reflex actions earlier in this chapter. Once light has entered your inner eye through the pupil it passes through the lens, a clear disc made up largely of proteins. The lens is held in place by suspensory ligaments and the ciliary muscles. It is the lens of the eye that \u2018fine-tunes\u2019 the focusing of the light, bending it to make sure that it produces an image on the retina (see How the retina works \u2013 Focusing the light). All of the light-sensitive cells are arranged together in a special light-sensitive layer at the back of the eye known as the retina. When an image is produced on the retina, the light-sensitive cells are stimulated. They send impulses to the brain along affector (sensory) neurons in the optic nerve. When the brain receives these messages it interprets the information and we understand the impulses as an awareness of a visual image \u2013 in other words, we see something. At the point where your optic nerve leaves your eye there is no retina. You have a blind spot. But take a look around your classroom \u2013 there are no missing bits in your field of vision. Your brain does a very good job of filling in the missing bits from your blind spots with information from the other eye. The only way you can prove that it is there is to use a bit of trickery yourself.",

        "chunk_text": "The light energy that falls on your retina is changed into electrical energy by the light-sensitive cells known as the rods and cones that make up your retina. Rods and cones contain chemicals that change when light falls on them. This change triggers an impulse in the affector neurons that make up the optic nerve. The impulses travel along the optic nerve to the visual areas of the brain (see page 59). The rods and cones then use energy to restore the chemicals to their original form. Rods respond to relatively low light levels, but they do not give a very clear image and they do not respond to different colours. This explains why, when light levels fall in the evening, the colour drains away and everything looks black and grey. Rods are spread across your retina except over the fovea (the small area of your retina which contains ONLY cones). Cones only work properly in bright light \u2013 but they respond to colours and give very clear, defined images. There are fewer cones than rods, and there are very few of them around the edges of the retina. This is why the edges of your visual field are blurred \u2013 but very sensitive to movement. The closer you get to the fovea the more cones there are, and the fovea itself has only cone cells. When light falls on your fovea you see clearly and in colour. Each cone responds to red, green or blue light. The colours you see depend on which combination of cones is stimulated \u2013 if all three are stimulated equally, you see white.",

        "topic": "Focusing the light",
        "chunk_text": "If you are going to see clearly, light from an object must be focused on your retina. For this to happen the light must be bent or refracted. Light rays are refracted when they pass from one medium to another \u2013 for example, from air into water. In your eye, the light coming in is bent (refracted) twice \u2013 once as it passes from the air through the cornea and then again as it passes through the lens. As a result of this refraction the image is focused onto your retina \u2013 and it is also upside down. The optical areas of the brain interpret this inverted image so that you are aware of the world the right way up. Sometimes we look at objects close to us \u2013 for example, when we are reading or studying. At other times we are gazing into the distance, looking at objects a long way away. The light arriving at our eyes in these circumstances is travelling differently. The light from a distant object reaching our eyes will be travelling in almost parallel rays, whilst the light from close objects will be spreading out or diverging very strongly. The cornea bends all of the light entering the eyes towards the retina, but it is the lens that makes sure that we can see both close and distant objects equally well. It does this by changing shape. Light from distant objects needs little further bending once it has passed through the cornea, so the lens is stretched long, thin and relatively flat and has little effect. However, light from close objects still needs some considerable bending to bring it into focus on the retina. The lens of the eye needs to be much thicker to focus light from near objects. It becomes shorter, fatter and much more convex (rounded) so that it bends the light much more. These changes in the shape of the lens are brought about by the contraction and relaxation of the ciliary muscles that surround them, which in turn pull \u2013 or don\u2019t pull \u2013 on the suspensory ligaments that hold the lens in place. Ability of the human eye to focus on objects at different distances is known as accommodation.",

        "chunk_text": "As people get older the lens of the eye may begin to harden, so accommodation becomes more difficult and they cannot focus so easily on close objects. This can make reading a problem, for example. However, it isn\u2019t only older people who can have problems with their vision. There are a number of common eye defects that can and do affect many people of all ages. There are a number of ways in which these problems can be treated \u2013 but they all involve the use of extra lenses to bend the light. A lens is a piece of transparent material (usually glass or plastic) that has one or more curved surfaces. An outward curve makes a convex lens and this will bend the light rays towards each other (a converging lens). An inward curve makes a concave lens and this will spread the light rays out (a diverging lens). In some people the normal method of accommodation in the eye that enables them to see close-up and distant objects with equal clarity just doesn\u2019t work properly: Short sight: A short-sighted person can focus clearly on things that are close to them but has much more difficulty with objects in the distance, which appear blurred. This may be as a result of a lens that is effectively \u2018too strong\u2019 \u2013 it is too curved even when the ciliary muscles are fully relaxed and so the light from distant objects is focused in front of the retina, making the image that actually lands on the retina spread out again and blurry. Another cause of short sightedness is when the lens is normal but the eyeball is particularly long \u2013 and again this means light is focused in front of the retina. This problem can be corrected using concave (diverging) lenses that spread the light out more before it gets into your eye. This means that the thicker lens can bring the rays of light into perfect focus on the retina \u2013 or there is room in the long eyeball for the light rays to be focused on the correct point. Long sight: A long-sighted person can focus clearly on things that are at a distance but has much more difficulty with objects close to them, which appear blurred. This may be as a result of a lens that is effectively \u2018too weak\u2019 \u2013 it is too flat even when the ciliary muscles are fully contracted and so the light from close objects is focused behind the retina, so the image that actually lands on the retina is spread out and blurred. Another cause of long sightedness is when the lens is normal but the eyeball is particularly short \u2013 and again this means light is focused behind the retina. This problem can be corrected using convex (converging) lenses that bring the light rays together more before they reach your eye. Now the thinner lens can bring the rays of light into perfect focus on the retina \u2013 or the short eyeball becomes the right length for the light rays to be focused on the correct point. Astigmatism: Astigmatism is another fairly common eye defect. The shape of the eye is irregular \u2013 more egg-shaped than round \u2013 so the cornea is curved asymmetrically and this affects the way light is focused on your retina. In some people it is the lens rather than the eyeball itself that is an unusual shape, but the end result is the same. Astigmatism can also be corrected by the use of lenses, but the situation is more complex than for long and short sight.",

The ear is divided into three regions: the outer ear, middle ear and inner ear. Look at figure 3.27 to see the structure of the ear as you read about how it works. The outer ear consists of a flap called a pinna. Leading from the pinna is a tube, the ear canal. In humans this is about 2 cm long. The pinna helps to trap and funnel sound into the ear. This is particularly important in animals with longer ears than humans, which can move the pinna to pick up sounds. At the end of the ear canal is a sheet of very thin membrane called the eardrum or tympanum that closes the tube. The pinna, ear canal and the eardrum form the outer ear. At the entrance of the ear canal are a number of small hairs. These filter out dust particles from the air entering the ear canal. The cells lining the ear canal produce waxy material which traps dust and germs, and lubricates the eardrum. Behind the eardrum is a cavity filled with air. This cavity contains three tiny bones and forms the middle ear. The three tiny bones \u2013 called the malleus (hammer), the incus (anvil) and the stapes (stirrup) because of their shape \u2013 are the smallest bones in your body. They form joints with one another, with the malleus attached to the eardrum and the stapes to the oval window. The cavity of the middle ear is connected to your throat by a tube called the Eustachian tube. This is usually closed but when the pressure in the middle ear increases \u2013 when you are flying, for example \u2013 the tube opens until the air pressure in the middle ear is equal to that in the throat and therefore to the atmosphere. At one end of the middle ear, opposite to the eardrum, there are two openings: one of them is oval in shape and hence it is called the oval window. The other is round and is called the round window. The openings are covered by very thin membranes. The inner ear consists of a cavity filled with a fluid, two sac-like structures called the sacculus and utriculus, three semicircular canals and a coiled tube called the cochlea. The sacculus, utriculus, semicircular canals and the cochlea are filled with a liquid. A cross section of the cochlea reveals that it is made up of three tubes in one (figure 3.28). The floor of the middle tube is lined with sensory cells linked to affector neurons. These nerve fibres join to form the auditory nerve which leads to the brain.",

This magnifies the vibrations, which are then transmitted through the ear ossicles (the small bones) to the oval window. The ear ossicles also amplify the fluid vibrations (make them bigger). The vibrations of the stapes make the membrane at the oval window vibrate. The vibrations of the oval window are transmitted to the fluid and then spread to the cochlea. Vibrations of the fluid cause the hair-like sensory cells to move. These movements in turn cause production of nerve impulses in the affector nerve fibres. These impulses are transmitted to the brain for interpretation. The human ear is sensitive to vibrations ranging from those of a very low note of about 20 vibrations per second, to a very high note of about 30 000 vibrations per second. High notes are detected in the first part of the cochlea and low notes are recorded in the last part of the cochlea.",

The swellings on each of the semicircular canals (the ampullae) contain sensory cells attached to sensory nerve endings. The sensory cells have hairs which are enclosed in a core of jelly substance called a cupula (figure 3.29). Whenever the body or the head moves, the semicircular canals move with the head. The fluid in the semicircular canals also starts to move but it lags behind in its motion and so it apparently moves in the opposite direction. The moving fluid causes the cupula to tilt, thus pressing the hairs of the sensory cells. The pressing of the sensory hairs creates nerve impulses in the sensory nerve endings. The nerve impulses are transmitted to the brain. The brain then interprets the direction and speed of motion of the body or head. The semicircular canals are all at right angles to each other, so each one is sensitive to movement in a different plane. One canal responds when you nod your head, one when you shake it and one when you tilt your head to the side. If you spin round and round fast and then stop, you will feel dizzy. This is because the fluid in your semicircular canals keeps on moving after you have stopped. Your ears are telling your brain that you are moving round, but your eyes and other senses are saying you are standing still \u2013 and these mixed messages result in the dizzy sensation. The utriculus and sacculus are concerned with your sense of balance and posture. The inner surfaces of these structures contain sensory cells with protruding hairs embedded in a jelly-like substance containing tiny particles of chalk called otoliths. When your head is tilted on one side, the otoliths move in the opposite direction, pulling or pressing the sensory hairs. This initiates nerve impulses which are transmitted to the brain. The brain then detects the angle of tilt and sets of reflexes are initiated, which tend to return the body to its normal posture. Your ear is not the only part of your body involved in giving you a sense of balance. The sense of balance is also affected by your vision and by stretch receptors in the muscles, which constantly help you to be aware of your position. Someone trying to stand on their toes with their eyes closed will invariably begin to fall forward. This is much less likely to happen if the same exercise is performed with the eyes open!",

If the eardrum is damaged, by a blow or by a very loud noise, deafness will result. This may be temporary or, if the eardrum fails to heal, it can be permanent. If the tiny bones of the middle ear become damaged or fused by infection, or crumble away with age or disease, you will be permanently deaf. Damage to the auditory nerve is another cause of deafness, and once the nerve is damaged it cannot be restored. Hearing loss can also be the result of infection, when the middle ear becomes full of thick infected mucus. This type of hearing loss can be reversed if the infection is cleared with antibiotics. However, if the infection lasts too long, permanent hearing loss may result.",

The sensory receptors of taste are located on the upper surface of the tongue, and to a lesser extent on the surface of the throat. The receptors for smell are located in the upper parts of the nasal passages. There are five basic taste sensations. The first four are sweet, sour, bitter and salt. We have known about these for many years. Very recently scientists have discovered a fifth taste called umami (a very savoury flavour found in foods such as meat, cheese, broth and mushroom). For many years it was thought that the receptors for the four known senses had their areas of greatest concentration on different parts of the tongue. It has now been clearly shown that in fact all of the five different taste organs are spread out all over the tongue, although some of them may seem to be in a greater concentration in certain places. A few substances stimulate only one of the five types of receptors, but most stimulate two, three, four or five types to varying degrees. The taste sensations you experience are produced by a blending of the five basic sensations in different relative intensities along with the input of smell from your nose. The sensation experienced by different people in response to the same stimulus may not be the same. The same substance can give rise to a sensation of sweet in one person if it stimulates primarily the sweet receptors. It can give rise to a sensation of bitter in a second person if it stimulates primarily the bitter receptors. There can be no sensation at all to a third person if it fails to stimulate any",

Many processes in the body are co-ordinated by chemical substances known as hormones. Hormones act as chemical messages, produced in one part of the body but having an effect somewhere entirely different. Glands are structures which produce hormones and other useful substances. Hormones are produced (secreted) by special endocrine glands found around the body. Many glands in your body are exocrine glands. This means they have a special tube or duct that carries the secretion from the gland where it is made to the place where it is needed. Sweat glands, salivary glands and mammary glands are all examples of exocrine glands. The endocrine glands that produce your hormones have no ducts, so they are sometimes known as ductless glands. They secrete hormones directly into your blood, and the chemicals are carried from the glands all around your body in the bloodstream. Most hormones only affect certain tissues or organs \u2013 their target organ \u2013 and the hormone is picked up from the blood by receptors in the cell membranes. They can act very rapidly, but often their effects are slower and longer lasting than the results of nervous control. This will be discussed in the next section. The pituitary gland, found in the brain and about the size of a pea, is sometimes described as the controller of the endocrine orchestra. The hormones made in this tiny gland control the secretion of many other hormones. Because of its position in the brain, it is also involved in co-ordination between the nervous and hormonal systems of control.",

Thyroxine is one of the hormones involved in the long-term chemical control of your body. It controls the metabolic rate of your body \u2013 how quickly substances are built up and broken down, how much oxygen your tissues use and how the brain of a growing child develops. If someone has an overactive thyroid that makes too much thyroxine, their metabolism starts to go very fast \u2013 the symptoms include losing a lot of weight, sweating a lot and becoming irritable. If the thyroid doesn\u2019t make enough thyroxine, people feel tired and lack energy. They may gain weight. Low levels of thyroxine can cause problems in getting pregnant, miscarriages and still births. If small children do not make enough thyroxine, their growth is stunted and they do not develop normally, and this damage can be permanent. They have difficulties in learning. This is called cretinism. The most common reason for not making enough thyroxine is a lack of iodine in the diet. Without iodine, the thyroid gland works very hard to try and make enough thyroxine but it cannot do it. The gland will grow and enlarge in an attempt to make the right amount of thyroxine. This is known as goitre. The enlarged gland can be felt in the neck. Eventually the goitre gets so big it can be seen as a swelling in the neck. Many people do not like the appearance of a goitre in their neck. Iodine deficiency disorders such as goitres are very common in Ethiopia. Several scientific studies have shown that between 30 and 40% of our population are affected by iodine deficiency to some extent. Women and children tend to be more affected than men. This may be because women have big demands on their bodies with pregnancy and breastfeeding, while children are growing. The problem is worse in rural areas, particularly in the mountainous regions where any iodine tends to be washed away out of the soil. In some areas up to 90% of school children show some level of iodine deficiency. Iodine deficiency affects the health of millions of people in Ethiopia. There is a simple solution for most of the problems of iodine deficiency and goitre. We need to include more iodine in our diet. There is a simple way to do this. Iodine can be added easily to the salt we use to season our food. Just that tiny amount of extra iodine is all we need to overcome all the problems that goitre and IDD (iodine deficiency disease) can bring! In areas where the iodine levels are very low, special iodised capsules can be used to help people overcome the deficiency. In the year 2000 about 28% of all households in Ethiopia used iodised salt. The Government and the Department of Health are working with other agencies to try and make sure that everyone in Ethiopia can get iodised salt by 2015. This would mean all of the disorders linked to iodine deficiency would go. Our goitres would disappear. Our women would suffer far fewer losses during pregnancy and birth. Our children would not fail to develop and become cretins. Every child would benefit and be able to learn more effectively. People would have more energy and be able to work more effectively. Adding more iodine to our diet in this simple way can have major effects on the well-being of millions of people in our country. It has worked elsewhere in the world \u2013 now it is our chance to overcome this simple but devastating disease.",

Glucose is transported around your body to all the cells by your blood. However, you don\u2019t spend all of your time eating to keep your blood sugar levels high and provide a constant source of glucose for your cells. Instead the level of sugar in your blood is controlled by hormones produced in your pancreas. When you digest a meal large amounts of glucose pass into your blood. Without a control mechanism your blood glucose levels would vary wildly. After a meal they would soar to a point where glucose would be removed from the body in the urine. A few hours later the levels would plummet and cells would not have enough glucose to respire. This internal chaos is prevented by your pancreas. The pancreas is a small pink organ found below your stomach. It constantly monitors your blood glucose concentration and controls it using two hormones known as insulin and glucagon. When your blood glucose concentration rises above the ideal range after you have eaten a meal, insulin is released. Insulin stimulates your liver to remove any glucose which is not needed at the time from the blood. The soluble glucose is converted to an insoluble carbohydrate called glycogen and stored in your liver. When your blood glucose concentration falls below the ideal range, the pancreas monitors it and secretes glucagon. Glucagon stimulates your liver to break down glycogen, converting it back into glucose and so releasing stored sugar back into the blood. By using these two hormones and the glycogen store in your liver, your pancreas keeps your blood glucose concentration fairly constant at about 90 mg glucose per 100 ml of blood (4\u20136 millimoles per litre).",

But for some people life isn\u2019t quite this simple, because their pancreas does not make enough \u2013 or any \u2013 insulin. Without insulin your blood sugar levels get higher and higher after you eat food. Eventually your kidneys produce glucose in your urine. You produce lots of urine and feel thirsty all the time. Without insulin glucose cannot get into the cells of your body, so you lack energy and feel tired. You break down fat and protein to use as fuel instead, so you lose weight. Type 1 diabetes appears in children and young people. It is inherited and you cannot avoid it. Type 2 diabetes appears later in life and it can be linked to being obese or possibly very underweight as well. Before there was any treatment for diabetes, people would waste away, fall into a coma and die. Fortunately there are now some very effective ways of treating diabetes. However, not everyone in Ethiopia knows about the treatment, and it can be difficult to get the treatment you need. If you have a mild form of diabetes, managing your diet is enough to keep you healthy. Avoiding carbohydrate-rich foods keeps the blood sugar levels relatively low so your reduced amount of insulin can cope with them. Getting regular exercise also helps your body cope with diabetes. However, many people with diabetes need replacement insulin before meals. Insulin is a protein which would be digested in your stomach, so it is usually given as an injection to get it into your blood. This injected insulin allows glucose to be taken into your body cells and converted into glycogen in the liver. This stops the concentration of glucose in your blood from getting too high. Then as the blood glucose levels fall, natural glucagon makes sure glycogen is converted back to glucose. As a result your blood glucose levels are kept as stable as possible. Insulin injections treat diabetes successfully but they do not cure it. Until a cure is developed, someone with diabetes has to inject insulin several times every day throughout their life. The treatment of diabetes has changed a great deal over the years. For centuries nothing could be done. Then in the early 1920s Frederick Banting and Charles Best realised that extracts of animal pancreas could be used to keep people with diabetes alive. For many years insulin from pigs and cows was used to treat affected people. This saved millions of lives. In recent years bacteria have been developed using genetic engineering which produce pure human insulin. This is now used by the majority of people affected by diabetes. It means that a regular, reliable supply of exactly the right chemical is always available. Now scientists are trying to find easier ways \u2013 like nasal sprays \u2013 to get insulin into the body. If the regular injections could be replaced it would certainly improve the quality of life for diabetics.

A general sequence of events is described here, but the order and speed in which changes occur is very much an individual thing \u2013 no two people experience puberty in exactly the same way. The chemical changes which trigger puberty are unseen, another important example of hormonal co-ordination and control. The pituitary gland in your brain starts to produce increasing amounts of FSH. This in turn stimulates the male gonads or testes to begin developing and producing the male sex hormone testosterone. The rising levels of testosterone trigger the many changes which affect the body during puberty, causing the development of the secondary sexual characteristics.

The female gonads are the ovaries, two walnut-sized organs found low in the abdomen. They are closely associated with the uterus and the Fallopian tubes, but are not actually attached to them. Girls often go into puberty slightly earlier than boys, and so between the ages of 8\u201314 most girls begin the changes which will take their bodies into sexual maturity. As with boys, the time and speed of puberty varies greatly from one person to another. Although it is different for everyone \u2013 and everyone ends up a slightly different shape and size \u2013 the basic changes which take place are the same. Just as in boys, puberty is controlled by hormones from the pituitary gland in the brain and from the gonads themselves \u2013 in this case the ovaries. FSH from the brain stimulates the ovaries to become active and start producing the female sex hormone oestrogen. As the levels of oestrogen rise and the body responds, all kinds of changes are triggered and the female secondary sexual characteristics develop. \u2022 The whole body undergoes the adolescent growth spurt, so you get taller. \u2022 Pubic hair and body hair (underarms) begin to grow. \u2022 The breasts develop. \u2022 The external genitalia become larger and the colour of the skin darkens. \u2022 The female pattern of fat deposits on the hips, buttocks and thighs develops. \u2022 The ovaries begin the production of mature ova and menstruation begins. \u2022 The uterus grows and begins to produce a thickened lining each month in response to hormones from the ovary. \u2022 The brain changes too as you make the transition from girl to woman.

They can also feel young and insecure, confused or angry for no real reason. It is all part of growing up and changing hormone levels are at least partly to blame.

The menstrual cycle is a sequence of events which takes place approximately every four weeks throughout the fertile life of a woman, from the age of puberty to around 50 years of age. A baby girl has ovaries full of immature ova, but they do nothing until after puberty. Then, once a month, a surge of the hormone FSH from the pituitary gland in the brain starts a few of the ova developing. FSH also affects the ovary itself which starts making the female hormone oestrogen. This in turn stimulates the uterus to build up a thick, spongy lining with lots of blood vessels ready to support a pregnancy. About 14 days after the ova start ripening, one of them bursts out of its follicle. This is called ovulation and when it happens the hormone levels from the pituitary begin to drop dramatically. After ovulation the remains of the follicle forms the corpus luteum (which means yellow body because it is filled with a yellowish fat) and this secretes a different hormone (progesterone). Progesterone makes sure that for some days the uterus lining stays thick and spongy and stimulates the growth of more blood vessels, ready to receive a fertilised ovum. If a pregnancy occurs the embryo will immediately get a rich supply of food and oxygen. But most months the ovum is not fertilised and the woman does not become pregnant. About ten days after ovulation (when no pregnancy has occurred) the ovary reduces the levels of both oestrogen and progesterone. As the chemical messages change again the blood vessels which are supplying the thick spongy lining of the uterus close down. The lining detaches from the wall of the uterus and is lost through the vagina as the monthly period or bleeding. However, if the ovum has been fertilised it will reach the uterus and sink into the thick, spongy lining, attach itself (implant) and start to develop.",

Produced by the pituitary gland in the brain: FSH (follicle stimulating hormone) stimulates the development of a follicle in the ovary, and within the follicle the egg matures and ripens. FSH also stimulates the ovaries to produce hormones, particularly oestrogen. LH (luteinising hormone). stimulates the release of the egg from the ovary in the middle of the menstrual cycle and also affects the ovary so that it produces another hormone (progesterone) to keep the uterus lining in place. Produced by the ovaries: Oestrogen stimulates the lining of the uterus to build up in preparation for pregnancy. It also affects the pituitary gland. As the oestrogen levels rise, the production of FSH by the pituitary gradually falls \u2013 which in turn means the oestrogen levels fall. The rise in oestrogen levels has the opposite effect on the levels of the other pituitary hormone, LH. As oestrogen rises, the production of LH goes up. When LH reaches its peak in the middle of the menstrual cycle it stimulates the release of a ripe egg from the ovary. Progesterone maintains the thickened lining of the uterus and stimulates the growth of blood vessels in the lining to prepare for a pregnancy \u2013 and if a fertilised ovum arrives in the uterus, progesterone helps to maintain the pregnancy. By the end of the cycle, when the menstrual bleeding is about to start, all of the hormones are at a low ebb. Because the ovaries only contain a limited number of ova, women do not have periods throughout their lives. Eventually the ova in the ovaries run out. The hormone levels drop, the ovaries and uterus shrink and the woman stops having periods. She is no longer fertile.

To understand how these birth control methods work, you need to understand how pregnancy comes about. For human reproduction to be successful the sperm made in the man\u2019s testes must meet up and join with an ovum released from the woman\u2019s ovary. The sperm gets inside the body of the woman during sexual intercourse. The erectile tissue in the penis fills with blood so that it becomes erect and can be placed inside the vagina. The sperm move from the testes through the urethra, and semen containing millions of sperm is released inside the vagina in a process known as ejaculation. The sperm move through the cervix into the uterus. They then make their way through the uterus and into the Fallopian tubes. It is here that the sperm will meet a ripe ovum, if the woman is at the right stage of her menstrual cycle. Out of the millions of sperm which set off, only a few hundred to a few thousand actually reach the ovum \u2013 and only one of those will actually fertilise it. Yet in spite of all the difficulties they face, sperm manage to reach the Fallopian tubes only around half an hour after they are released.\nThe ovum which bursts from the follicle at the moment of ovulation has no way of moving itself. The end of the Fallopian tube moves across the surface of the ovary to pick up the ovum. It is then moved along the tube by the beating of the cilia, which carry the ovum towards the uterus.\nWhen a single sperm joins with the ovum this is the moment of fertilisation, which in humans is also known as conception. The nucleus from the sperm, containing the chromosomes from the father, fuses with the nucleus from the ovum, containing chromosomes from the mother, and a potential new life begins. The new cell (known as the zygote) has a unique set of chromosomes. If all goes well, it will develop into a baby.\nSadly here in Ethiopia we have a very high rate of maternal deaths in childbirth \u2013 871 women for every 100 000 births. This is partly because in our large and rural country, many women do not have health professionals with them to help when they are giving birth. But some of the problems we can do something about ourselves. Girls\u2019 bodies do not stop growing and maturing until they are at least 18. If a girl becomes pregnant before she is 18\u201319 years old, she is much more likely to be damaged as she gives birth, and there is a higher chance that she and her baby might die. Sensible use of contraception (see below) means that women need not become mothers while they are still children themselves. If a wife is young, the couple can be careful and use contraception until the girl is older and can bear a baby safely. Women are also more likely to die in childbirth if they have many children close together. Again we can do something about this. If couples use contraception to help them space their children further apart, this gives the mother\u2019s body time to heal and get strong again. She is less likely to die giving birth, and her children will be stronger and healthier too. Healthy women have healthy babies, so the more we can do to prevent diseases such as goitre and HIV/AIDS in our country, the healthier our families will be.",

        "topic": "Controlling fertility \u2013 contraception",
        "chunk_text": "Many people do not wish to risk pregnancy whenever they have sex. People have tried for thousands of years to control their fertility and to have babies exactly when they wanted them. Methods of avoiding pregnancy have included vinegar-soaked sponges and mixtures of camel dung and various herbs placed in the vagina before intercourse, and reusable condoms made from animal intestines. Many of these traditional methods of contraception were harmful and did not work, they were not scientific at all.\nIn the 21st century we have a wide range of contraceptive choices. Contraception means \u2018against pregnancy\u2019 and it describes ways in which pregnancy can be avoided. There are several different types of contraception. The effectiveness of contraceptive methods is measured per \u2018100 woman years\u2019 \u2013 in other words, if a hundred women use a method of contraception for a year, how many of them would end up pregnant? By choosing to use contraception, men can protect their wives from having too many children too quickly, or from having a baby too young. By using condoms, men cannot only avoid unwanted pregnancies but protect themselves and their partners from HIV/AIDS and other sexually transmitted diseases. Women can protect themselves by insisting men use condoms, or by using female methods of contraception such as the pill. When couples work together, the reproductive health of both of them can be protected.\nNatural methods of contraception are based on understanding the menstrual cycle and accurately predicting the moment of ovulation. Ovulation can be detected by the increase in temperature associated with it, by changes in the vaginal mucus or by using a monitor which detects changes in the chemicals in the urine around ovulation. If sexual intercourse is avoided around the fertile time, pregnancy can be avoided.\nAdvantages: there are no side effects and this method is permitted by most religions. Carried out with care and scientific precision about recording techniques it can be very effective.\nDisadvantages: it depends on full co-operation of both partners and it is not always easy to pinpoint ovulation so pregnancy can result.\nEffectiveness: 10 pregnancies per 100 woman years.\nNatural methods are considered to be birth control because they use the natural cycles of the body to space out the number of children born and simply avoid sexual intercourse to ensure that the ovum and the sperm do not meet. Breastfeeding a baby also helps to space a family as a woman often does not ovulate while she is fully breastfeeding a baby. However, most methods of contraception set out to prevent conception or the implantation of the embryo whilst sexual activity continues whenever the couple desire it. Community-based reproductive health programmes can give help, advice and contraception.\nPhysical or barrier methods of contraception involve physical barriers which prevent the meeting of the ovum and the spermatozoa.\n\u2022 Condoms \u2013 a thin latex sheath is placed over the penis during intercourse to collect the semen and so prevent ovum and sperm meeting. Gives better protection against pregnancy when combined with spermicide.\nAdvantages: no side effects, don\u2019t need medical advice, used every time you have sex offers protection against sexually transmitted diseases such as syphilis and HIV/AIDS.\nDisadvantages: can interrupt intercourse. Sheath may tear or get damaged during intercourse, allowing semen to get through.\nEffectiveness: 2.5 pregnancies per 100 woman years.\n\u2022 The female condom \u2013 a thin sheath worn by a woman during sex. It lines the vagina so that sperm cannot enter the cervix.\nAdvantages: no side effects, don\u2019t need medical advice, used every time you have sex it protects from infection with HIV/AIDS or other sexually transmitted diseases.\nDisadvantages: can only be used once, can be expensive, gives better protection against pregnancy when used with spermicide, takes practice to insert it properly.\n\u2022 The diaphragm or cap \u2013 a thin rubber diaphragm is inserted into the vagina before intercourse to cover the cervix and prevent the entry of sperm.\nAdvantages: no side effects, offers some protection against cervical cancer.\nDisadvantages: must be initially fitted by a doctor. May be incorrectly positioned or damaged and allow sperm past. Gives better protection against pregnancy when combined with spermicide.\nEffectiveness: 2.5 pregnancies per 100 woman years.\nHormonal methods use variations on your natural hormones to prevent conception.\n\u2022 The mixed pill \u2013 one of the most reliable methods of contraception. The pill contains the female hormone oestrogen. This raises the level of oestrogen in the blood which is detected by your pituitary gland, which in turn slows the production of FSH. Without rising FSH levels no follicles develop in the ovary and no eggs mature to be released. Without mature ova there can be no pregnancy. The pill also contains progesterone, so the mucus in the vagina and cervix change as if a pregnancy has occurred to stop more sperm getting in. The pill must be taken regularly \u2013 if the artificial hormone levels drop the body\u2019s own hormones can take over and an egg can be released unexpectedly. The progesterone only pill (mini-pill) doesn\u2019t contain oestrogen so it does not inhibit ovulation and needs to be taken at very precise time intervals to be effective.\nAdvantages: the combined pill particularly is very effective at preventing pregnancy. The pill is taken at regular daily intervals and so does not interfere with intercourse. It may offer some protection against certain tumours.\nDisadvantages: the pill may increase the risk of certain tumours. It can cause raised blood pressure and an increased tendency for the blood to clot.\nEffectiveness (combined pill): 0.5 pregnancies per 100 woman years (due to human error in taking the pill).\n\u2022 Hormone injections \u2013 in this method of contraception a woman is given an injection of hormones which prevents pregnancy for up to three months. The injections stop ovulation, cause changes in the mucus of the cervix to prevent sperm getting through and reduce the lining of the uterus so a fertilised ovum would not be able to implant.\nAdvantages: very effective at preventing pregnancy. Only need an injection every three months.\nDisadvantages: you can\u2019t change your mind once you have had the injection \u2013 you can\u2019t get pregnant for about 3 months. There are some side effects \u2013 it can affect your periods and may give you headaches.\nEffectiveness: 1 pregnancy per 100 woman years (because sometimes women don\u2019t get their injections regularly enough).\n\u2022 Hormone implants \u2013 this method involves implanting small silicone capsules containing female hormones very like those in the contraceptive pill under the skin. They release small doses of hormone and prevent pregnancy for up to five years. If a woman wants to become pregnant the implant can be removed.\nAdvantages: the implant is very effective at preventing pregnancy and can last for up to five years.\nDisadvantages: there can be side effects including changes to your periods, headaches and depression.\nEffectiveness: 0.5\u20131 pregnancy per 100 woman years.\nSterilisation or surgical contraception is the ultimate form of contraception. By cutting or tying the tubes along which eggs or sperm travel conception is rendered almost impossible. This has the additional benefit of removing the human element of contraception, which is the major cause of failure in the other methods.\n\u2022 Vasectomy \u2013 in men the sperm ducts (vas deferens) are cut, preventing sperm from getting into the semen.\n\u2022 Female sterilisation \u2013 in women the Fallopian tubes are cut or tied to prevent the ovum reaching the uterus or the sperm reaching the ovum.\nAdvantages: almost 100% guaranteed to prevent pregnancy. Permanent control of fertility. Removes the problem of human error in contraception.\nDisadvantages: for women in particular it involves a general anaesthetic. Not easily reversible.\nEffectiveness: 0.05 pregnancies per 100 woman years.\nThe IUD or intrauterine device does not prevent conception \u2013 the ovum and the sperm may meet \u2013 but it interferes with and prevents the implantation of the early embryo. An IUD is a device made of plastic and a metal, frequently copper, which is inserted into the uterus by a doctor and remains there all the time.\nAdvantages: once inserted, no further steps need to be taken. Relatively effective at preventing implantation and pregnancy.\nDisadvantages: can cause pain and heavy periods. Can cause uterine infections which may lead to infertility. If pregnancy does occur it has a high chance of being in the Fallopian tubes (ectopic pregnancy).\nEffectiveness: 2.5 pregnancies per 100 woman years.\nEffective family planning using a reliable method of contraception can have a big impact on individuals and on society. If every child is a wanted child, born when the parents feel ready both financially and emotionally to support a baby, then everyone benefits. Couples who have children when they want them can enjoy those children. Having the number of children you choose, and spacing the births to give the mother time to recover from one pregnancy before she is pregnant again, makes for healthier women, healthier children, less poverty and generally happier families. This in turn means society functions better. Less money needs to be spent supporting children who are unwanted or uncared for by their families or on dealing with the health problems which result from too many pregnancies too close together. This frees up money for other things. Regular use of condoms can also reduce all the problems which come from HIV/AIDS.",

        "chunk_text": "Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) is the medical term for a combination of illnesses that result when the immune system is weakened or destroyed. It is the advanced form of an infection caused by Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV), a virus that attacks the immune system, making the sufferer susceptible to other diseases.\nIntroduction\nHIV/AIDS is a big problem in Ethiopia. Between 60 000\u201370 000 people die of AIDS every year, at the moment, and well over a million people are infected with the virus.\nHIV attacks the your immune system so you cannot fight off infections such as TB or even a cold.\nHIV, the virus that leads to AIDS, can be spread through four bodily fluids \u2013 blood, semen, vaginal secretions and breast milk. The virus can only be spread from an infected person if his or her bodily fluids enter the bloodstream of an uninfected person. It is most commonly spread through unprotected sex with an infected partner (without using a condom). In Ethiopia more people are infected through heterosexual sex than any other way.\nAn HIV-infected mother can infect her baby during pregnancy, at birth or through breastfeeding. HIV can also be passed on by an infected blood transfusion or by sharing non-sterilised needles, syringes or razors. It is a particular problem with drug addicts who share needles.\nAn individual can become infected from only one exposure. You only need to take a risk once \u2013 but once you are infected with HIV you can infect others. How would you know if you have HIV/AIDS \u2013 what are the symptoms?",

        "chunk_text": "The symptoms of HIV/AIDS are different at different stages of the disease. After about three months some people start to feel unwell \u2013 early symptoms include fevers, headaches, tiredness, and swollen glands, but not everyone infected with HIV feels ill. These symptoms are very mild and easily mistaken for an ordinary infection. But after about three months, HIV antibodies appear in your blood \u2013 you become HIV-positive\nAs the immune system weakens, an infected person may develop more symptoms (relatively mild at first), including swollen lymph glands, night sweats, fever, cough, diarrhoea, and/or weight loss. As the disease progresses the symptoms become more noticeable and more severe.\nThe symptoms of the final stages of AIDS include:\n\u2022 extreme fatigue\n\u2022 rapid weight loss\n\u2022 appearance of swollen or tender glands in the neck, armpits or groin\n\u2022 unexplained shortness of breath, frequently accompanied by a dry cough\n\u2022 infections such as TB and pneumonia\n\u2022 persistent diarrhoea\n\u2022 intermittent high fever\n\u2022 appearance of one or more purple spots on the surface of the skin, inside the mouth, anus or nasal passages caused by a rare cancer, Karposi\u2019s sarcoma\n\u2022 whitish coating on the tongue, throat or vagina as fungal infections take hold\n\u2022 forgetfulness, confusion and other signs of mental confusion\nThe incubation period\nThe first symptoms appear 3\u201312 weeks after you have become infected. This is the initial incubation period of the virus. Before this you can\u2019t even detect the infection with a test because your body has not produced enough antibodies. People who think they may have been infected and receive a negative test result should do a second test three months later to be absolutely sure of their HIV status. During the waiting period they should either not have sex or use a condom properly at all times. People who look healthy can infect you with HIV/AIDS.\nAfter the first mild symptoms the disease incubates again. In Ethiopia many people will progress from HIV infection to full-blown AIDS in 2\u20133 years, because they are already suffering from other diseases or just from a shortage of food. During this time the virus reproduces rapidly, infecting the cells of the immune system and destroying them. However, in very healthy, well-fed people with the best medicines available the incubation period is much longer. It can take 20 years or more before all the symptoms of the disease appear.",

Antiretroviral medications are used to control the reproduction of the virus and slow the progression of HIV-related disease. Some of the early symptoms of HIV can be treated \u2013 the secondary infections can be treated with antibiotics, the fungal infections with antifungal drugs and any anaemia with iron and transfusions.\nSome of the factors that affect how quickly HIV infection can develop into AIDS can be controlled by the infected person. A healthy lifestyle, with a good balanced diet, regular exercise, no smoking or illegal drug use, and drinking alcohol in moderation if at all can help you to stay well for longer. By carefully managing your lifestyle and so keeping your immune system healthy you can help your body cope with the effects of the virus for as long as possible.\nAnti-HIV medications do not cure HIV infection and individuals taking these medications can still transmit HIV to others.

The more partners you have, and the more times you have unprotected sex, the more you put yourself at risk. If people avoid the use of substances, such as alcohol, which can affect their judgement and make you more likely to take part in risky behaviour, fewer mistakes will be made.\nThere are other ways in which you can protect yourself. You should never use drugs that are non-medicinal, especially those that require needles. Sharing needles between drug users is very dangerous, so setting up needle exchanges where intravenous drug users can get clean, sterile needles on a regular basis is another way of preventing the spread of HIV/AIDS.\nIt is important to practice precautions when handling blood and the body fluids as well as body refuse. This has important implications for hospitals and doctors. What\u2019s more, blood for transfusions needs to be thoroughly screened for HIV antibodies \u2013 a precaution already taken in Ethiopia.\nPregnant women need to be screened, and if found to be at risk, given drugs to reduce the risk of infecting their unborn child. Caesarean deliveries are advised, and HIV-positive mothers should bottle feed their babies if at all possible as the virus can pass through to the baby in the breast milk. Without this intervention, 25\u201330% of all babies born to HIV-positive mothers will be infected with the virus. At the moment only about 1% of pregnant women who are HIV-positive in Ethiopia are given the antiretroviral drugs needed to protect their unborn child.\nMost of all, people around the world need to be educated about the risks of HIV/AIDS, how it is passed on and how to avoid it.\nIt is very important that you, our young people, develop the personal skills which will help you reduce the risk that HIV/AIDS poses both to you as individuals and to our society. It is important to be assertive. Girls and young women must be able to insist that their sexual partners use a condom for sex. Boys and young men must learn to respect their partners and to take responsibility for their own sexual health and that of others by using condoms. Young people need to make decisions about their own behaviour and that of their local community about how to care for and support people who are already living with HIV/AIDS, and how to reduce the risk of this terrible disease for future generations.",

        "topic": "Female genital mutilation and reproductive health",
        "chunk_text": "In Ethiopia, we are leading the way in recognising that some of our traditional practices, carried out with the best of intentions, can in fact cause great damage and are part of the reason for our high rates of HIV/AIDS infections. One of these harmful traditional practices is female genital mutilation (FGM) also known as female genital excision (FGE) or more locally as \u2018removing the dirt\u2019.\nFemale genital mutilation is a process which is carried out across Ethiopia. There are various forms of FMG. All of them involve removing part of the external genitalia of young girls in surgery which is carried out without any anaesthetic, using blades or sharpened obsidian. In some forms of the process almost all of the external genitalia are removed, and the whole region is sewn together leaving a single small opening for the passage of urine and menstrual blood. Sometimes FGM is carried out on babies, but more often it is performed when girls are aged from six up until just before marriage. Traditionally people believed that FGM keeps girls pure and is necessary for them to be accepted by men in marriage.\nWomen were traditionally completely dependent on men, and so anything which helped them to marry successfully was done.\nIn some regions of our country almost every girl will undergo FGM. In other areas, numbers are lower. For example, about 54% of girls in SNNPR experience FGM, with 92% in Amhara and up to 100% in Somali.\nIn Ethiopia, with great wisdom and understanding, many people have begun to understand that this traditional practice causes harm rather than good. Bogaletch Gebre is a shining example of this. Not only was she the first Ethiopian woman to join the science faculty at the University of Addis Ababa, she has also established the Kembatta Women\u2019s Self-Help Centre, Kembatti Mentii Gezzima-Tope (KMG). This organisation aims to help women and men throughout Ethiopia understand the best way forward for a strong and healthy population in our country.\nOur government has set up a national committee known as the Eradication of Harmful Traditional Practices (EHTP). This committee is working with leaders of Islam, Christianity and other religions and with many other organisations to help everyone in our country change their minds and make different choices. People often do not understand all of the problems which can result from cutting a young girl in this way.\nUnfortunately FGM, rather than protecting our girls, puts them at great risk in many different ways.\n\u2022 The process of FGM when a girl is cut can result in serious bleeding and infections which can kill. In Ethiopia today, with our high rates of HIV/AIDS, it can put our girls at risk of HIV infection too. The traditional practitioners who carry out the process may carry out 20 FGMs a day. If one of those girls was infected as a baby, her blood could infect all of the other girls cut that day.\n\u2022 When the genital region is sewn closed, girls are at constant risk of infection. This can make them infertile (unable to have children). It can also affect their kidneys and kill them.\n\u2022 Because the process of FGM leaves much scarring, this means that sexual intercourse is often very painful for women. This does not help them to feel close and loving towards their husbands. It also means that sexual intercourse often causes bleeding on the damaged scar tissue of the genitalia. This makes it very easy for them to become infected with HIV/AIDS if their partner carries the disease. FGM is one of the reasons why HIV/AIDS levels are so high in Ethiopia. It is also part of the reason why our women \u2013 and so, very often, our children \u2013 are so badly affected by this killer disease.\n\u2022 The terrible scarring and narrow vaginal opening often left by FGM means that cut women often have big problems giving birth. The stitching and scarring can tear open, so the woman loses a great deal of blood. Sometimes the baby cannot be delivered alive, and in many cases the woman may die.\nEHTP and others are helping people across the country to understand just how damaging FGM can be and that the alternatives are very positive for the country as a whole. When girls are not cut they remain healthier. They are less likely to become infected with HIV/AIDS which also means they are more likely to have healthy children. They are more able to have a full and happy relationship with their husbands. Because they are healthier, they can work harder and bring more prosperity to the family. And they are much less likely to die in childbirth or to lose their baby. Of course women want to be married, but as more and more girls become educated they can be equal partners with their husband and they do not need to be cut to be married.\nTo help people around the country understand the choices that can be made there are films of a young girl being cut. Many men realise for the first time what a terrible thing is done to their daughters and wives. They recognise how damaging FGM really is.\nOrganisations such as the EHTP show people how positive marriage can be when girls remain uncut, and how much healthier those girls remain.\nThe Government wants to make full use of the women of Ethiopia to help our country grow. To do that it needs them to be healthy and whole and so FGM is against the law. Our Government recognises that people need to feel good about their decisions and is working hard to help people see the advantages of leaving girls uncut.\nEducation for both boys and girls is very important in this.\nReligious leaders have made it clear that FGM is against the principles of both Islam and Christianity and is not part of the Koran or the Bible. They too are working to make their communities healthier for everyone and protect the girls under their care from this harmful practice.\nThe traditional practitioners who carry out the cutting are very influential in the community. The money they earn for cutting girls increases their income and it gives them high status. However, more and more traditional practitioners are giving up cutting girls. They are using their knowledge and status in the local communities to explain to parents why it is better to leave their daughters uncut. They are becoming very valuable advisers on the prevention and treatment of HIV/AIDS. They are paid for this work and become more important in the community than ever before. They will play a big part in maintaining the future health of Ethiopia.\nAround the world many people admire the way that the Government and people of Ethiopia have recognised that modern knowledge and the arrival of HIV/AIDS means that some long-held traditional practices are now very harmful. The way our country is changing its traditions to keep our women healthy and reduce the spread of HIV/AIDS is an example to many other countries in Africa and beyond.\nEthiopia is not alone in trying to tackle this harmful traditional practice. In December 2009, female genital mutilation was made illegal in Uganda, punishable by 15 years in jail.",

        "chunk_text": "Just stop and think for a moment about the different conditions in which people live around the world. From the warmth of Africa to the cold of the Arctic tundra, from the arid dryness of the Sahara desert to the risk of flooding in the Nile delta \u2013 there are few areas of the planet where people have not settled, survived and thrived. What is more, think about the different conditions your own body finds itself in during a single day. You may eat lots of food, or you may eat very little, you may spend time training for sport in the sun, or swim in the river, or sit in the shade. You may be ill and have a fever. You may even take a flight to a country with a very different climate from your own land. But, however much your external environment may change, things inside your body need to stay the same.\nHere are some of the main threats to a stable state inside your body.\n\u2022 You eat several times a day, so sometimes products of digestion are flooding into your blood and at other times little or no food is available from the gut, yet your cells need a constant supply of glucose for respiration.\n\u2022 When you respire, you produce a poisonous waste product \u2013 carbon dioxide. If levels build up in your body they change the pH of your tissues. This in turn could denature your enzymes and so stop your cell chemistry completely.\n\u2022 As you break down the products of digestion, poisonous wastes are produced, such as the urea which comes from the breakdown of amino acids in your liver. A build-up of urea could poison and kill you.\n\u2022 Whenever you exercise you produce heat from your muscles. This can increase your core body temperature, as can spending too much time in the sun or having a fever. If your body temperature gets too high, your enzymes will denature and so all your cell chemistry will come to a halt and you may die.\n\u2022 If you lose too much heat from your body because the external conditions are very cold, or you lose a lot of body heat, the cellular reactions slow down and you may die.\n\u2022 The amounts of water and salt you take in vary greatly throughout the day and from day to day, and so does the amount of water and salt you lose through sweat and urine \u2013 yet the water balance inside your body needs to stay the same to keep the cells in osmotic balance.\nAs you can see, keeping your internal conditions in a stable state isn\u2019t easy \u2013 yet this is what your body manages to do 24 hours a day, every day of your life. The nervous and hormonal systems which you discovered in sections 3.1, 3.2 and 3.3 play an enormous role in maintaining this important balance. Feedback mechanisms involving both the nervous system and hormonal systems play a very important part in maintaining homeostasis. Most of these control systems in the body are examples of negative feedback. This means that when levels of a substance in your body rise, changes are made which lower the levels again. Similarly, when levels of a substance fall, changes are made so that it rises again to the original levels. Look out for these feedback mechanisms as you learn about homeostasis.\nControlling temperature\nOne of the most important factors which animals need to control is the internal or core body temperature.\nHeat is a form of energy which is produced in a number of ways including by the sun and by artificial heating systems. It is also generated by the chemical reactions which take place in your own body. Temperature is a way of measuring hotness or coldness (the effect of heat energy) on a relative scale.\nIt is vitally important that wherever we go and whatever we do our body temperature is maintained at the temperature (around 37 \u00b0C) at which our enzymes work best. It is not the temperature at the surface of an organism which matters \u2013 the skin temperature can vary enormously without causing harm. It is the temperature deep inside the body, known as the internal or core body temperature, which must be kept stable. We can get a good measure of our human core body temperature by taking the temperature in the mouth, in the anus or on the surface of the eardrum.\nLiving organisms are continually gaining heat from cellular respiration and by conduction, convection and radiation from their surroundings. They are also constantly losing heat by the evaporation of water from the body surfaces and by conduction, convection and radiation to their surroundings. It is the balance of these gains and losses that gives the core temperature. Organisms use a number of different ways to shift the balance and allow themselves to gain or lose heat as they need to.\nNot all animals need to control their core body temperatures. Protista and small animals living in big bodies of water like the sea have no means of temperature regulation because they do not need them.\nLarger animals living in many different habitats must be able to regulate their body temperatures so they can avoid cell damage from overheating, but also gain enough heat to have an active way of life. There are two types of animals:\nPoikilotherms \u2013 organisms whose body temperature is governed by the external temperature. They rely largely on the environment for their body heat. Their body temperature can vary over a wide range, for example, fish and reptiles.\nHomoiotherms \u2013 organisms with a relatively constant internal body temperature which is usually higher than the external temperature, for example, birds and mammals.\nHumans are a well-known example of homoiotherms.\nTemperature control in poikilotherms\nPoikilothermic animals have to rely on changes to their behaviour and their body structures to use the heat in their environment to maintain a reasonably steady and useful body temperature.\nWhen they are cold they may:\n\u2022 bask in the sun\n\u2022 press their bodies close to a warm surface\n\u2022 erect special sails or areas of skin which will allow them to absorb more heat from the sun\nWhen they are getting too hot they may:\n\u2022 move into the shade\n\u2022 move into water or mud\nTemperature control in homoiotherms\nHuman beings are good examples of homoiotherms. Our body temperature is controlled by a number of physiological mechanisms which work together to allow us to gain or lose heat as we need to.\nPhysiological methods of temperature regulation in homoiotherms\n\u2022 Sweating \u2013 when you are hot sweat oozes out of the sweat glands and spreads over the surface of the skin. Sweat is made up mainly of water and salt but also contains a small amount of nitrogenous waste. As the water evaporates it cools the skin, taking heat from the body. Because water and salt are lost in the sweat, when you sweat a lot this can affect your water and ion balance so you need to take more water and ions in through drink or food to replace the water and ions which are lost. It is important to remember that sweat itself is not cool, and it can only cool you down if it evaporates. In hot, humid conditions you may sweat a lot \u2013 but it won\u2019t cool you down because the water can\u2019t evaporate! In cold weather, little or no sweat is formed so that as little heat as possible is lost by evaporation.\n\u2022 Vasodilation \u2013 if the body temperature starts to go up, the blood vessels supplying the capillaries in your skin dilate, so that more blood flows through the capillaries. Your skin flushes and more heat is lost through radiation from the surface. This is known as vasodilation and it is particularly obvious in pale-skinned people. Less blood flows through the slightly deeper vessels in your skin as a result.\n\u2022 Panting and licking \u2013 many mammals have thick, furry coats and so cannot evaporate sweat easily from the skin surface even when they are getting hot. Some animals, such as dogs and cats, only have sweat glands in small areas of the skin such as the feet. So to increase the amount of heat lost through evaporation, these animals may lick themselves, coating parts of their bodies with",

We wear warm clothes when the weather is cold and fewer, cooler clothes when the external temperature is hot. \u2022 Seeking shade or shelter \u2013 like many other animals, people look for shade to keep them cool when it is hot and sunny, and look for shelter from cold, wet or windy conditions to help prevent excess heat loss and keep themselves warm, for example, native male rats live underground in burrows all the time in arid deserts. \u2022 Taking high-calorie food in cold conditions. We need to use more metabolic energy to keep warm so we eat high-calorie food in cold conditions. Birds and other mammals do the same. \u2022 Hibernation \u2013 in countries which have very cold winters, some homoiothermic animals will hibernate. They cannot eat enough to keep their body temperature stable through the cold winter, so they sleep through the bad conditions. These animals eat a lot and gain a lot of fat before hiding away in a warm nest or burrow and going into a very deep sleep. Their metabolic rate falls and so does their body temperature. They do not wake up until the warmer weather of spring arrives with more food for them to eat, for example, dormice and hedgehogs in the UK. \u2022 Aestivation \u2013 in hot countries, some animals \u2018hibernate\u2019 through the hottest weather as they cannot keep their bodies cool enough. These animals usually hide themselves underground or under a layer of mud and go into a deep sleep until conditions cool down again, for example, East African land snails can aestivate for up to three years in times of extreme drought. \u2022 Wallowing or bathing \u2013 some animals cannot lose enough heat through sweating alone to keep their bodies cool enough in hot weather. This is a particular problem for some larger animals. By wallowing in mud or bathing in water, the animals cover themselves in water and the water evaporates from the surface of their skin, cooling them down, for example, elephants and pigs. \u2022 Burning fires, central heating, air conditioning, etc. \u2013 people can change the temperature of their environment. By burning a fire or turning on the heating we can warm things up and reduce the heat we lose, keeping us warmer. Air conditioning is used in some buildings and vehicles to cool the air down if it gets too hot, so the people inside can lose more heat and keep themselves cool.",

        "chunk_text": "At only a few degrees above or below normal body temperature our enzymes cannot function properly. If this goes on for any length of time the reactions in our cells cannot continue and we die. As you have seen, all sorts of things can affect your internal body temperature, including heat generated in your muscles during exercise, fevers caused by disease and the external temperature rising or falling. Human beings have an internal control mechanism, a system of homeostasis which enables us to lose excess heat if our core temperature starts to rise, yet generate and conserve heat when our core temperature starts to fall. How does this temperature control mechanism work? Control of the temperature relies on the thermoregulatory centre in the brain. This centre contains receptors which are sensitive to the temperature of the blood flowing through the brain itself. Extra information comes from the temperature receptors in the skin, which send impulses to the thermoregulatory centre giving information about the skin temperature. These receptors are so sensitive they can detect a difference of as little as 0.5 \u00b0C. When the thermoregulatory centre detects changes in temperature, our first responses are conscious \u2013 we put more clothes on, or take clothes off, move outside or light a fire. But if the core temperature starts to move in one direction or the other, automatic body responses take over. The control of the body temperature is an example of a negative feedback loop. The feedback control of the body temperature involves the thermoregulatory centre in the brain and the skin.",

        "chunk_text": "The homeostatic mechanisms of temperature control in your body usually work very effectively. However, if conditions become too extreme and things go wrong with your temperature control mechanism, the need for this homeostasis quickly becomes very clear indeed. For example, when the weather becomes extremely hot and humid, and when people undertake exceptionally challenging physical activity like running a marathon, the normal homeostatic mechanisms may not cope. For example, eventually there is not enough spare water in the body to produce sweat. The salt and water balance is destroyed and then the core temperature will rise to dangerous levels. Once this happens people may die. On the other hand, if your core body temperature falls too low you suffer from hypothermia. In Ethiopia hypothermia can be seen sometimes in new-born infants if they are small and have little body fat, or if they are not dried and wrapped up warm to be cuddled by their mother as soon as possible after birth. In cooler climates such as the UK this silent killer claims around 30 000 lives every year. People with hypothermia have greyish-blue, puffy faces and blue lips. Their skin feels very cold to the touch, and they will be drowsy with slurred speech. As it gets worse, they will stop shivering. If the body temperature falls too low the sufferer will become unconscious and may die. Your surface-area-to-volume ratio is an important factor here. Smaller people \u2013 such as children \u2013 have a much bigger surface area to volume ratio than larger people. You lose heat through the surface of your body \u2013 so small people lose heat relatively faster than larger people. As a result babies, children and small adults are more at risk of becoming too cold than larger people. Big people, on the other hand, have a greater risk of overheating as their relatively small surface area to volume ratio means they cannot lose large amounts of heat effectively.",

        "chunk_text": "Excretion \u2013 getting rid of the waste products which could build up in your body and damage your cells \u2013 is one of the most important aspects of homeostasis. There are two main metabolic waste products which would cause major problems in your body if the levels rise \u2013 carbon dioxide and urea. Your body deals with them both very differently. Metabolic wastes are materials which are produced by the metabolic processes of life. The organs which are involved in getting rid of these metabolic wastes are known as excretory organs. The main excretory organs in your body are your lungs, your kidneys and your skin. The carbon dioxide produced during cellular respiration is almost all removed from the body via the lungs when you breathe out. So the lungs are not only the site of gas exchange for respiration, they are also an excretory organ removing carbon dioxide waste very effectively from your body. If the levels of carbon dioxide increase as you exercise, the level is picked up by sensory receptors in your arteries and brain, which send electrical impulses to stimulate the breathing centres in your brain. In turn, these send impulses to make you breathe faster and deeper. As a result, the carbon dioxide levels fall. This is picked up by the same receptors and so the stimulation of the breathing centres is reduced, and in turn the breathing rate falls. This is an example of a feedback mechanism \u2013 as the carbon dioxide levels go up, the breathing rate goes up which makes the carbon dioxide levels fall, so the breathing rate returns to normal as well. Another metabolic waste which can cause serious problems is urea. Urea is produced in your liver when excess amino acids are broken down. These excess amino acids come from protein in the food you have eaten and from the breakdown of worn-out body tissue. If you eat too much carbohydrate or fat, you can store it (as glycogen or fat) until you need it. However, your body cannot store excess protein or amino acids, so any excess is always broken down. The amino acids are converted into carbohydrate (which can be stored or used) and ammonia. The ammonia is then combined with carbon dioxide (getting rid of another metabolic waste) to make urea. The urea which is produced is a form of nitrogenous waste and it leaves your liver via the blood. The urea is then filtered out of the blood by the kidneys and removed in the urine. Your kidneys are one of your main excretory organs, and also one of your main organs of homeostasis. They play a vital role in the removal of urea from the body, but their role in homeostasis is even more important, because they also play a major part in regulating the water and salt balance of your body.",

Yet some days you may drink several litres of liquid and other days much less. How is the balance maintained? We gain water when we drink and eat. We lose water constantly from the lungs when we breathe out \u2013 water evaporates into the air in the lungs and is breathed out. This water loss is constant. Whenever we exercise or get hot we sweat and lose more water. The water balance is maintained by the kidneys. They remove any excess water and it leaves the body as urine. If we are short of water we produce very little urine and most water is saved for use in the body. If we have too much water then our kidneys produce lots of urine to get rid of the excess. The ion concentration of the body \u2013 particularly ordinary salt \u2013 is also important. We take in mineral ions with our food. Some are lost via our skin when we sweat. Again the kidney is most important in keeping an ion balance. Excess mineral ions are removed by the kidneys and lost in the urine. The balance of water and salts in your body is very important because of the osmotic impact on your cells if the balance is wrong so controlling this balance is known as osmoregulation.

        "topic": "The kidneys",
        "chunk_text": "How do the kidneys remove urea and control the levels of water and ions in your body? Blood flows into the kidney along the renal artery. The blood is filtered, so fluid containing water, salt, urea, glucose and many other substances is forced out into the kidney tubules. Then everything the body needs is taken back (reabsorbed), including all of the sugar and the mineral ions needed by the body. The amount of water reabsorbed depends on the needs of the body. The waste product urea and excess ions and water not needed by the body are released as urine. Each kidney has a very rich blood supply and is made up of millions of tiny microscopic tubules (nephrons) which are where all the filtering and reabsorption takes place. The roles of the different areas of a single kidney tubule in the production of urine are described below: \u2022 Bowman\u2019s capsule: the site of the ultrafiltration of the blood. The blood vessel feeding into the capsule is wider than the vessel leaving the capsule, which means the blood in the capillaries is under a lot of pressure. Several layers of cells \u2013 the wall of the blood capillaries and the wall of the capsule \u2013 act as a filter and the blood cells and the large blood proteins cannot leave the blood vessels as they are too big to fit through the gaps. However, water, salt, glucose, urea and many other substances are forced out into the start of the tubule \u2013 in fact the concentration of substances in the liquid in the capsule is the same as that in the blood itself. This process is known as ultrafiltration \u2013 filtration on a very small scale. \u2022 Glomerulus: the knot of blood vessels in the Bowman\u2019s capsule where the pressure builds up so that ultrafiltration occurs. The volume of blood leaving the glomerulus is about 15% less than the blood coming in \u2013 which is a measure of the liquid which has moved into the capsule as a result of ultrafiltration. \u2022 First coiled (convoluted) tubule: the liquid which enters this first tubule is known as the glomerular filtrate. The first tubule is where much of the reabsorption takes place. All of the glucose is actively taken back into the blood along with around 67% of the sodium ions and around 80% of the water. It has many microvilli to increase the surface area for absorption. \u2022 Loop of Henl\u00e9: where the urine is concentrated and more water is conserved. \u2022 Second coiled (convoluted) tubule: where the main water balancing is done. If the body is short of water, more is reabsorbed into the blood in this tubule under the influence of the anti-diuretic hormone or ADH. (Diuresis means passing urine, so anti-diuresis means preventing or reducing urine flow.) See below for more details of this mechanism. Also ammonium ions and some drugs (if they have been taken into the body) are secreted from the blood into this tubule to get rid of them. By the end of this second coiled tubule all of the salt which is needed by your body has been reabsorbed, leaving the excess in the filtrate along with most of the urea. \u2022 Collecting duct: where the liquid (essentially urine) is collected. It contains about 1% of the original water, with no glucose at all. The level of salt in the urine will depend on the amount of salt in your diet and the water content of the urine. There is also a much higher concentration of urea in the urine than in the blood \u2013 about 60 times more, in fact. But if your body badly needs more water, more may be reabsorbed along the collecting duct \u2013 again under the influence of ADH \u2013 until the urine passes into the pyramid of the kidney and on into your bladder. Urine is formed constantly in your kidneys, and it drips down to collect in your bladder. The bladder is a muscular sac which can hold between 600 and 800 cm3 urine, although we usually empty it when it contains only 150\u2013300 cm3. We can control the opening of the bladder thanks to a strong ring of muscle known as a sphincter at the entrance to our urethra, the tube that leads from the bladder to the outside world. We can open and close this sphincter voluntarily, although it also opens as a reflex action if the bladder is too full \u2013 or if we are very frightened! When we are young, we have to learn to control our bladder sphincter voluntarily. The amount of water lost from the kidney in the urine is controlled by a sensitive feedback mechanism involving the hormone ADH. If the water content of the blood is too low (so the salt concentration of blood increases) special sense organs known as osmoreceptors in your brain detect this. They stimulate the pituitary gland in the brain to release ADH into the blood. This hormone affects the second coiled tubules of the kidneys, making them more permeable so more water is reabsorbed back into the blood. This means less water is left in the kidney tubules and so a more concentrated urine is formed. At the same time the amount of water in the blood increases and so the concentration of salts in the blood returns to normal. If the water content of the blood is too high, the pituitary gland releases much less ADH into the blood. The kidney then reabsorbs less water back into the blood, producing a large volume of dilute urine. Water is effectively lost from the blood and concentration of salts returns to normal. This system of osmoregulation is an example of negative feedback. As the water concentration of the blood falls, the level of ADH produced rises. Then as the water concentration of the blood rises again, the level of ADH released falls. On an average day your kidneys will produce around 180 l (that\u2019s about 50 gallons) of liquid filtered out of your blood in the glomerulus (glomerular filtrate) \u2013 but only about 1.5 l (just over 2.5 pints) of urine. So more than 99% of the liquid filtered out of your blood is eventually returned to it. You can observe the way in which your kidney works to maintain water balance in your own body. If you drink a lot of water, you will quickly notice that you need to urinate more often, and that you produce large quantities of very pale coloured, dilute urine. If, on the other hand, you are in a situation where you cannot get enough to drink, you will urinate much less frequently and produce a small volume of dark coloured, concentrated urine. This is a very elegant example of homeostasis in action. Your skin also plays a part in the salt and water balance of the body. It forms a waterproof layer around the body tissues which protects us from the uncontrolled loss of water from our body tissues by evaporation. It also prevents you from gaining water by osmosis every time you go swimming in the river! The skin also loses salt and water through the process of sweating. This can affect the ion and water balance of your body when you sweat a lot. But this is a relatively uncontrolled loss. You sweat to help the body cool down, not to control the ion and water balance of the body. The kidneys have to work to support the changes to the concentration of the body fluids that result from sweating excessively.",

        "chunk_text": "Your kidneys and skin are not the only organs of homeostasis. The liver also plays a large role in maintaining a constant internal environment. It is the largest individual organ in your body \u2013 in fact it makes up around 5% of your body mass. Your liver cells are very active \u2013 they carry out a wide range of functions, many of which help to maintain a constant internal environment. The liver has a very special blood supply. As well as the usual artery and vein (the hepatic artery and vein) there is another blood vessel which comes to the liver directly from the gut. This is the hepatic portal vein and it brings the products of digestion to the liver to be dealt with. A large number of reactions take place in the liver. Many of them are involved in homeostasis in one way or another. It plays a part in all of the following functions: \u2022 Control of the sugar levels in the body (through stored glycogen in the liver itself). \u2022 Controlling and balancing the fats that you eat and the cholesterol levels in your blood. \u2022 Protein metabolism \u2013 your liver breaks down excess amino acids and forms urea. If you eat more carbohydrate or fat than you need in your diet your body simply stores the excess energy as fat. If you eat too much protein, it isn\u2019t so easy. Your body cannot store the excess amino acids or simply convert protein to fat. Instead the amino acids which make up the protein are broken down in your liver. The amino (nitrogen containing) part of the amino acid molecule is removed and converted into ammonia and then urea in the liver. The rest of the amino acid can be used in cellular respiration or converted to fat for storage. The process of removing the amino group from excess amino acids is known as deamination and it is a very important function of the liver. \u2022 The breakdown of worn-out red blood cells \u2013 in particular the red pigment haemoglobin. \u2022 The formation of bile which is made in the liver and stored in the gall bladder before it is released into your gut to emulsify fats and help in their digestion. \u2022 Control of toxins \u2013 your liver breaks down most of the poisons you take into your body, including alcohol. This is why the liver is so often damaged when people drink heavily. \u2022 Temperature control. Around 500 different reactions take place in the liver at any time. For many years it has been believed that as a result of all these reactions the liver generates a lot of heat which is then spread around the body by the bloodstream. Increasingly scientists think that the reactions which generate heat are cancelled out by reactions which use heat, so that in fact the liver produces very little excess heat. Any that is produced is used around the body. The liver is a very important organ and we need to look after the health of our livers. The best way to do this is to avoid drinking too much alcohol, which can cause cirrhosis of the liver. The liver tissue is destroyed which can eventually kill you. Heavy drinkers also often develop liver cancer which spreads quickly and can be fatal. As you have seen, homeostasis is a delicate balance throughout your body as all of the changes which come with everyday life are resisted by your body to maintain the constant internal environment that cells need to work properly.",

The energy that is captured is used to convert carbon dioxide from the air and water from the soil into a simple sugar, glucose, with oxygen as a by-product. Some of the glucose produced during photosynthesis is used immediately by the cells of the plant for respiration to provide energy for cell functions, growth and reproduction. The energy released in respiration is used to build up smaller molecules into bigger molecules: \u2022 Sugars like glucose are built into starch for storage. \u2022 Sugars like glucose are built into molecules like fructose (fruit sugar) and sucrose (a double sugar unit) to be transported around the plant. \u2022 Sugars like glucose are built up into more complex carbohydrates like cellulose to make new plant cell walls. \u2022 Sugars, along with nitrates and other nutrients that the plant takes up from the soil, are used to make amino acids. These amino acids are then built up into proteins to act as enzymes and make up much of the cytoplasm of the cells. \u2022 Sugars may be built up into fats and oils (lipids) for storage in seeds and to make up part of the cell membranes. \u2022 Sugars may be used to build up important large molecules such as chlorophyll, using minerals such as magnesium taken up from the soil. Some of the glucose produced by photosynthesis is always converted into starch for storage, at least as a first step. This is because glucose is soluble and so could affect the water balance within the plant. If the concentrations of glucose vary in different parts of the plant then osmosis takes place to correct this and this could upset the whole organism. Starch is insoluble, which means that it does not dissolve, so it has no effect on the concentration of solutions. This means that it can be stored in different places without having any effect on the water balance of the plant. Starch is also a very compact molecule, so it takes up relatively little room, and it is easily broken down again into glucose molecules when it is needed by the cells of the plant. Because so much starch is produced, we often use it to show us that photosynthesis has taken place in a plant.",

Unfortunately you can\u2019t just add a few drops of iodine solution to the leaves of a plant to see if it has made starch \u2013 the waxy cuticle forms a waterproof layer so the iodine cannot penetrate and the green colour could mask a slight colour change.

        "chunk_text": "Everyone knows that plants need light for photosynthesis \u2013 but in fact that is not completely true. The simple equation we use for photosynthesis represents many different chemical reactions that go on in the chloroplasts of a plant to convert carbon dioxide and water into glucose and oxygen. And while light is absolutely necessary for some of those reactions, others can continue even if there is no light at all. The light-dependent reactions cannot take place without light energy. The light energy is absorbed by chlorophyll molecules through activation of their electrons and used to split water molecules into hydrogen and oxygen. Adenosine triphosphate (ATP) for energy is produced as well. The hydrogen is used in the rest of the process, and the oxygen is given off as a gas. It is a waste product of the light reactions of photosynthesis. The hydrogen and ATP produced in the light reaction are then used in a series of reduction reactions that convert carbon dioxide into glucose. This stage of the process does not need light to take place and is known as the light-independent reaction. However, for all practical purposes we can still say that plants need light for photosynthesis \u2013 because without the products of the light-dependent reaction the light-independent reactions can\u2019t take place at all! For most plants the source of light energy for photosynthesis is the sun, although in some cases people intervene and supply extra artificial light. If plants are deprived of light for any substantial amount of time they will die, because once the stores of starch have been used up they are not replaced and so there is no energy available for the metabolic reactions of the cells. It is important to be able to show that plants need light for photosynthesis \u2013 how do you think it might be done? Make a list of your ideas and then read on. The simplest way of demonstrating the need of a plant for light is to deprive it of light and see what happens. You can keep a whole plant in the dark for two to three days \u2013 this is called destarching the plant \u2013 and then compare the leaves with those from a plant kept in the light. Alternatively you can cover either a whole leaf or part of a leaf of a destarched plant with black paper or foil. This prevents light from reaching the covered area. If the plant is then left in the light for several hours and the covered leaf is tested for the presence of starch and compared to an uncovered leaf the difference is plainly visible (see figure 4.5). However, starch is not the only end product of photosynthesis. Oxygen gas is produced as well. While we cannot easily observe the oxygen gas produced during photosynthesis in land plants, it is a useful way of showing that photosynthesis is taking place in water plants. They give off bubbles of oxygen-rich gas from their leaves and from any cut or broken stems when they are photosynthesising. You can use this to show that light is needed for photosynthesis to take place, simply by collecting the gas collected from a water plant kept in the dark and one kept in the light. The gas given off by the plant in the light will relight a glowing splint \u2013 showing that it is rich in oxygen. The much smaller amount of gas collected from the plant in the dark does not do this \u2013 in fact it will extinguish the splint as it is rich in carbon dioxide from respiration. You can also use this method to measure the rate at which photosynthesis takes place when you look at the limiting factors in photosynthesis.",

There are lots of carbon-containing chemicals in existence, but carbon dioxide from the air or in solution in water is the only form that plants can use in photosynthesis. Carbon dioxide is found more or less everywhere. It is even produced by the plants themselves as a result of cellular respiration, so getting hold of it isn\u2019t usually a problem. However, although there is always sufficient carbon dioxide available for some photosynthesis to take place, sometimes the levels are too low for plants to take full advantage of the light available. Demonstrating that plants need carbon dioxide for photosynthesis is not easy. You can easily remove the carbon dioxide from the air surrounding a leaf or a plant using potassium hydroxide, which absorbs CO . However, the individual plant cells still produce carbon dioxide as they respire and so it is almost impossible to entirely deprive a plant of the gas. A more valid approach is to change the levels of carbon dioxide in the air surrounding a plant in high-intensity light and measure the changes in the rate of photosynthesis. As the carbon dioxide level increases, the rate of photosynthesis goes up. With plenty of raw materials the plant is able to take full advantage of the light energy falling on it.",

All the cells of a plant have a constant supply of water both as a waste product of respiration and from the transpiration stream (see section 4.3), so there is always plenty of water for photosynthesis. Water is vital to all the functions of a plant. This means you cannot demonstrate that water is required for photosynthesis just by depriving the plant of it \u2013 the plant would die long before the effect of lack of water on photosynthesis would show. The only way to show that water is needed for the process of photosynthesis is to supply the plant with \u2018heavy\u2019 water containing the 18O isotope of oxygen. These atoms are radioactive, and the radiation they produce can be detected as it is taken up and used by the plant. Substances like this are known as radioactive tracers. This experiment not only shows that water is needed for photosynthesis, it also makes clear what part the water plays. It shows that the oxygen gas produced during photosynthesis comes from the splitting of the water molecules using light energy. This is known as photolysis (splitting using light).",

If a destarched variegated plant is then exposed to light for several hours and you test one of the leaves for the presence of starch, the iodine solution changes colour only in those regions of the leaf that were green.

        "chunk_text": "Photosynthesis is one of the most important reactions on Earth. It is through photosynthesis that the ultimate source of energy for the Earth \u2013 in other words, the sun \u2013 is tapped and converted into chemical energy which is available to life. Around 35 \u00d7 1015 kg of new biological material is produced every year as a result of photosynthesis. This new material can then be used as a food source by billions of living organisms, including people. On the land, it is plants that photosynthesise and make food. It is easy to forget that actually almost two-thirds of the surface of the Earth is covered in water, and much of the photosynthesis of the world goes on in large bodies of water. The organisms that carry out photosynthesis in water may be true plants, such as water weeds, but they also include many algae and most importantly of all, the photoplankton (also known as phytoplankton). These are tiny organisms, protists and bacteria, which carry out photosynthesis and produce over half of the biomass of the Earth. That is a lot of material \u2013 remember the total biomass made by photosynthesis each year is around 36.8 \u00d7 1013 kg! At the moment people rely mainly on the photosynthesis which takes place on land to supply them with their food. Most of our food crops such as teff, sorghum, millet, corn, barley, beans and other pulses are all plants grown in the soil. Some cultures such as China use seaweeds and other algae which photosynthesise in water as an important source of food but most only use the biomass created by photosynthesis in the oceans indirectly, when they eat fish. So in many ways the photosynthesis which takes place in large bodies of water is a wasted resource. Scientists are looking hard at ways in which algae might be used as a future source of both human food and fuels to replace fossil fuels. Algae grow at a tremendous rate and replace themselves very rapidly. They not only produce biomass very rapidly, they also produce large amounts of oxygen and use up carbon dioxide. At the moment there are a number of problems to overcome, including how to grow and harvest algae in a controlled way, how to make food from algae acceptable to eat in cultures which are not familiar with it and how to convert algae into fuel. However, as the human population grows and food becomes more of a problem, scientists will almost certainly overcome these difficulties and algae will become a regular part of the human diet around the world. Photosynthesis is very important as the source of energy for almost all living organisms, because of the way in which photosynthesis provides us with new biological material. However, it is important to the health of the environment in other ways as well. Almost all living organisms need oxygen for cellular respiration. That oxygen is produced as a waste product of photosynthesis. We need enormous numbers of plants to photosynthesise to maintain atmospheric and water oxygen levels. Living organisms produce carbon dioxide as a waste product when they respire. Carbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas \u2013 it helps to trap heat from the sun around the surface of the Earth. It is also poisonous at high levels. However, carbon dioxide is also vital for photosynthesis to take place. Plants and other photosynthesising organisms remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere all the time. So photosynthesis is very important for maintaining the balance of oxygen and carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. If something happens to affect this balance, it can affect the life of everyone on Earth. For example, if carbon dioxide levels build up, this may lead to global warming. Anything which reduces the amount of carbon dioxide removed from the atmosphere by photosynthesis can lead to a carbon dioxide build-up. In many countries around the world, people have been cutting down trees both to use for timber and also to provide more open land for growing food crops or grazing cattle. This deforestation results in the loss of massive areas not only of trees but of all the other plants which grow in a wooded area. In South America deforestation is a tremendous problem with vast areas of tropical rainforests being destroyed every year. Once they are lost it is hard to replace that richness and variety of plants. We in Ethiopia have been involved in the process of deforestation \u2013 between 1990 and 2005 only we reduced our beautiful forests by 14% \u2013 that is about 2.1 million hectares of photosynthesising woodland. Loss of photosynthesising power like this can lead to a build-up of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere and ultimately an increase in global warming. However, here in Ethiopia we have recognised the problem and we are leading the way in replanting forests with native trees. You will learn more about global warming in unit 5, section 5.5.",

These transport systems rely heavily on osmosis, diffusion and active transport. Trees are obviously supported by their woody trunks. But many plants do not have woody tissue, and so they have no structural support. They rely on having cells which are rigid and firm. These firm cells are maintained by the movement of water into the cells by osmosis to create turgor. This is one reason why osmosis is so important for plants. Osmosis is not only vital for keeping the plant cells turgid. It is also very important for moving water around within the plant itself. Plants take up water through their roots. The water in the soil has a very low concentration of dissolved minerals. In other words, there is a very high concentration of water. Water moves into the plant root cells across the cell membrane along a concentration gradient. The roots are covered with special cells, which have tiny hair-like extensions called the root hairs. These root hairs increase the surface area for osmosis to take place. Once water has moved into the root hair cells, the cytoplasm of the root hair cells is more dilute than the cytoplasm of the surrounding cells. Water moves into the neighbouring cells by osmosis (see figure 4.10). These cells now have more dilute cytoplasm than the cells next to them, and the water moves on by osmosis until it reaches the xylem and the transpiration stream.",

The sugars that are produced in the leaves and carried all around the plant can also be stored. However, plants cannot store sugars, because they have an osmotic effect. If a cell had lots of sugar in it, lots of water would move into it by osmosis. So sugars are converted into starch, which is osmotically inert. This means that a cell can contain lots of starch and it has no effect on the movement of water by osmosis into or out of the cell. The starch stored in plant cells is broken down to sugars again to provide them with energy when the need arises \u2013 for example, when there isn\u2019t enough light to photosynthesise. One of the main places where starch is stored is in the storage organs of plants. Root tubers, stems and leaves can all be filled with starch to form storage organs. These enable plants to survive difficult conditions and also to reproduce. Starch is also deposited in large amounts in many fruits and seeds. In fruits the starch provides a reason for animals \u2013 including people \u2013 to eat the fruit and the seeds, helping to disperse the seeds. In the seeds, starch is one of the energy stores for the developing embryo to use as the seed starts to develop. We take advantage of these starch stores in plants and use them as food. Starch from plants is a very good energy source for people all around the world! The movement of water and minerals from the roots is just as important as the movement of food. The minerals are needed for the production of proteins and other molecules within the cells. The water is needed for two main reasons. One is that water is needed for photosynthesis and without water photosynthesis cannot take place. Less obviously, but just as important, water is needed to maintain the turgor pressure within the cells. As you saw earlier, water moves into plant cells by osmosis. This produces turgor so the cytoplasm presses against the cell walls. In fact for young plants and non-woody plants this is the main method of support. This pressure in the cells is very dependent on water moving up through the xylem from the soil. It is also very important in keeping the leaves firm and spread out to catch the sunlight. If the supply of water stops, the whole plant, or just the leaves, will wilt and all the chemical processes of photosynthesis and respiration will be affected.",

Plants lose water vapour from the surface of their leaves. This loss of water vapour is known as transpiration. Most of the transpiration takes place through the tiny holes in the surface of the leaf known as stomata. The stomata are there to allow air containing carbon dioxide into the leaf for photosynthesis. They can be opened and closed by the guard cells which surround them (see activity 4.9). Losing water through the stomata is a side effect of opening them to let carbon dioxide in, but it is vital for transpiration. Most of the stomata are found on the underside of the leaf.",

The sausage-shaped guard cells become very turgid, and as they swell up they bend, opening a gap \u2013 the stoma \u2013 between them (see figure 4.15). The pore closes by the reverse process \u2013 water moves out of the guard cells by osmosis into the surrounding cells and as the level of turgor in the guard cells falls, the stoma closes. You can make a model of a stomatal pore using long balloons to represent the guard cells. Try it yourself \u2013 when the balloons are fully blown up, the pore is open.

There is pressure pushing the water up from the bottom \u2013 the root pressure \u2013 as water moves in by osmosis. In the xylem, two physical forces help the water to move upwards. There are adhesive forces between the water and the walls of the xylem which support the whole column of water, no matter how tall it is. And as molecules evaporate away from the surface of the leaf, the following molecules are pulled upwards by cohesive forces between the water molecules. In other words, the water molecules tend to stick together and get pulled upwards like a string of beads. However, the main pull which moves water up from the roots to the leaves is the almost constant evaporation of water from the leaves. When water reaches the xylem in the leaves, there is a reversal of the situation in the roots. Now the solution in the xylem has a much higher concentration of water than the solution in the mesophyll cells in the leaf. Water moves out from the xylem into the mesophyll cells and so across the leaf by osmosis. When it reaches a mesophyll cell which is surrounded by air, water evaporates from the surface into the air and diffuses out through the stomata along a concentration gradient.",

This maintains a good concentration gradient for diffusion and increases evaporation. So transpiration is more rapid in hot, dry and windy conditions than it is in still or humid conditions. Plenty of light also speeds up transpiration. In good light conditions, lots of photosynthesis takes place and so the stomata are opened to allow plenty of carbon dioxide in.

They may have very thick, waxy cuticles to reduce any water loss through the overall leaf surface to an absolute minimum. Others have developed very hairy leaves, which trap a micro-atmosphere around the stomata and reduce water loss. Yet other plants have reduced their leaves to very narrow spikes to reduce the surface area over which water may be lost. On some plants the stomata are sunk into pits. Another way of preventing water loss, which you often see in grasses, is for the leaves to be rolled, trapping a micro-environment of moist air inside.

Examples of plant hormones are auxins (including indole-acetic acid, IAA), gibberellic acid, cytokinin, ethylene and abscisic acid. Some of these hormones promote growth, others inhibit it. Some of them will promote growth in one type of plant tissue and inhibit it in others! Auxin (IAA) is the best-known plant hormone and it is involved in general plant growth. It stimulates the elongation of the new plant cells, so they get longer and bigger. It is also involved in apical dominance. IAA is made at the tip of the main shoot and as it moves down the stem it slows down the growth of side shoots. So the main shoot dominates the whole plant. If you cut off the growing tip of a plant it will bush out. The side shoots grow quickly once you remove the apical dominance from the auxins produced by the main shoot. Auxin also stimulates the growth of roots. If auxin is applied to a cut stem it will stimulate new roots to grow \u2013 this is widely used by gardeners and farmers in some parts of the world to help them take successful cuttings. The best-known function of auxins is in the responses of plants to the world around them. The responses of plants towards things such as light and gravity are called tropisms and you will be looking at these in more detail later in this section. Another group of plant hormones are the gibberellins. These hormones stimulate the growth of plant stems. If you take a dwarf plant and give it IAA, nothing much will happen. If you give it gibberellins the stems will grow until the plant is a normal size. Gibberellins also help seeds to break their dormant period and start to grow. Scientists think they do this by stimulating the production of the enzymes needed to break down the food stores in the seeds. Cytokinins are hormones that stimulate cell division in plants so they are very important in plant growth. The balance between auxins and cytokinins in a tissue culture of plant cells decides whether roots or shoots will grow. Ethylene, a plant hormone, is a gas at room temperature and it causes fruit to ripen. It also causes fruit and leaves to fall from the plant in some species. Abscisic acid (ABA) is another important plant hormone. It inhibits growth and plays a major role in leaf fall. It is also involved in seed dormancy. There is some evidence that it may be involved in geotropisms, but it plays a small part compared to IAA.",

        "topic": "How are tropic responses brought about?",
        "chunk_text": "As you can see from your earlier experiments, plants respond to unilateral stimuli. Further experiments have allowed scientists to find out more about these responses. Maize grains germinate to produce a straight shoot called a coleoptile. Coleoptiles are widely used in experiments to investigate the role of hormones in shoot growth. It is known that the growth region of a shoot is some distance below the tip. This fact suggests that removal of the tip would not affect the growth of the shoot. However, when the tips of the coleoptiles are removed (they are decapitated), they don\u2019t grow. Since we know that the growth of a shoot is promoted by auxins, failure of decapitated seedlings to grow suggests that the auxins are probably produced in the tip. It has been found out that the growth hormone, auxin, produced in the tip is indole-3-acetic acid (IAA). IAA diffuses from the tip to the growth region to initiate growth. In the decapitated seedlings, although the source of IAA production was removed, the seedling grew for a while and then stopped. This is because some IAA had already diffused away from the tip before decapitation. This amount of IAA was responsible for the slight growth. The fact that IAA promotes growth in shoots suggests that it is also involved in the responses of the shoots to light and gravity. A simple experiment such as that in figure 4.25 shows you clearly that the tropic response of a plant to gravity is brought about by growth. Shoots lit from one side only also respond by growth \u2013 the shaded side grows faster than the illuminated side so the shoot bends over towards the light. IAA promotes growth so it seems likely that the shaded side of shoots affected by one-sided light had more IAA than the illuminated side. Since the growth curvature was influenced by light, it suggests that light is somehow involved in the distribution of IAA in the shoot. Experiments have shown that IAA diffuses away from light. When a shoot is illuminated on one side, IAA in that side diffuses towards the dark side of the shoot. This causes a build-up of the hormone in the dark side of the shoot. Since growth is directly proportional to the amount of IAA, the dark side will grow faster than the illuminated side. This explains the observed growth curvature of shoots shown in the experimental set up in figure 4.26. The upward growth of the shoot and the downward growth of the root, when the bean seedlings were placed horizontally, involve plant hormones. In the shoot, the force of gravity causes an accumulation of IAA on the underside of the plumule. The build-up of IAA on the underside promoted more growth in that region than the upper portion. This differential growth resulted in the stem growing upwards. The downward growth of the root is also influenced by IAA, but in the root tip the hormone inhibits growth, rather than stimulating it. The force of gravity causes an accumulation of IAA on the underside of the root, resulting in reduced growth in that region. The corresponding upper side of the root, which had very little or no IAA, grows faster than the underside. This differential growth results in the downward curvature of the roots. The different effects of this hormone on root and shoot growth are illustrated in figure 4.28.",

Water, for example, is one of the important requirements for photosynthesis. This means that when positive hydrotropism occurs, roots come into close contact with water. This makes it possible for them to absorb as much water and mineral salts as possible for the plant. In addition to water, plants require light for photosynthesis. When a plant responds positively to light its leaves become well exposed to it. This maximises the amount of light available for photosynthesis.",

This means that renewable resources are disappearing from our countries.\nBiodiversity is a measure of the wealth of species in a given place. It includes everything from the smallest microbe to the largest animal.\nSometimes biodiversity is measured just as the number of species in a given area at a particular time. Sometimes it is measured as the number of species breeding in an area at a particular time. This second measure is more accurate. An animal might be just passing through on the day you observe what is there so it is more accurate to measure the species which live and breed in an area! But just counting the number of different species of organisms in an area gives us a good idea of biodiversity and is easier to do.",

        "chunk_text": "You have learnt in your work on food chains and food webs how all the organisms in an ecosystem are dependent on one another. You have also learnt that the variety of organisms can affect the physical conditions around them. Ecosystems are linked on a large scale across the Earth. If biodiversity is reduced in one area, the natural balance may be destroyed elsewhere. Healthy biodiversity is important for the health of the planet. The air and water of the Earth are purified by a wide range of organisms. Waste is decomposed and removed by many different organisms. Photosynthesis by plants plays an important part in stabilising the atmosphere and the world climate. Plants absorb water from the soil which evaporates into the atmosphere through transpiration. This helps determine where rain will fall. Plant roots hold the soil together. This reduces the risk of flooding and makes sure that the soil is not blown away and remains fertile. Plant pollination, seed dispersal, soil fertility and the nitrogen cycle are all needed for natural ecosystems and for farming. They rely on good biodiversity to work properly.\nBiodiversity also gives us the genetic diversity we need to develop crops to grow in different conditions. A wide range of biodiversity means we can breed the cattle, sheep, goats and other livestock that are best suited to our climate. We can also bring in new genes as climate conditions change. Biodiversity also means that there are many different types of plants and animals which can act as a source of medicines, clothing, food and other useful things for people.\nBiodiversity matters for the appearance of our country. Areas that are rich in a wide variety of plants and animals are good to look at. People come from all over the world to admire and enjoy our wonderful biodiversity as we have such a rich heritage of animals and plants. Huge fields with a single crop (called monocultures) are not attractive to look at and they do not support a wide range of other animals and plants. However, it is not just a matter of looks. If biodiversity is low, the organisms are much more likely to be attacked by disease as it will spread from one to another very quickly. In a more diverse ecosystem some of the organisms will not be affected by a disease and the spread will be stopped.\nHowever, biodiversity is being lost around the world for many different reasons. In many countries huge areas of land are used to grow single crops such as oil palms, maize and wheat. These monocultures greatly reduce biodiversity. Deforestation is a big problem too \u2013 here in Ethiopia we have cut down most of our original forests with huge loss of biodiversity. Climate change, pollution and human activities have reduced biodiversity around the world.\nNow we understand how important biodiversity is, we need to look at ways in which it can be conserved. Conservation means keeping and protecting a living environment. There are a number of ways in which we can conserve biodiversity. Individual species may be protected, so that it is illegal to capture, kill or harm them. People can reduce pollution and around the world nations are looking at ways in which they can reduce the levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere and reduce climate change if possible. The loss of habitats can be reduced \u2013 for example, if deforestation is stopped and more forests are replanted biodiversity may be increased again. One of the most effective ways of conserving biodiversity is to protect large areas of habitat so that natural biodiversity is conserved in a very large area. Ethiopia is leading the way in this. We have designated at least 12 regions of the country as National Parks, areas where the wildlife and plants are protected and biodiversity can thrive. You will be looking at some of our National Parks in more detail in this section.",

Plants are used for building materials \u2013 wood is used to build our homes and plants are used to thatch the roofs. We also export timber such as blue gum (bahir zaf) logs as construction material. We use vegetation to make clothing \u2013 cotton and hemp are just two examples of plants that are used to make fabrics for clothing. Plants are also a source of medicines; both herbal medicines and many western medicines are originally based on chemicals from plants. For example, the root bark of the tree known locally as \u2018waginos\u2019 (in Ge\u2019ez) or \u2018yedega abalo\u2019 has been used for centuries to treat dysentery and koso is a medicinal plant that gets rid of worms.

Unfortunately, as we are blessed with such a rich and diverse vegetation, we have not as a nation conserved that gift until recent years. But perhaps we are not too late! We have used our resources without thought for the future \u2013 in each area of the country the available vegetation has often been destroyed. However, now we are looking at the past and making great efforts for the future. For example, Emperor Zera Yakob (1434\u20131468) is said to have organised the collection of the seeds of many indigenous trees such as juniper (tid), olive (woira) and podo (zigba) from the Wof-Washa forest near Debre Sina. He had them planted on the Menagesha Mountain. The Menagesha forest is still one of the best preserved in the whole country. Not all efforts at conservation are completely successful! In 1895 Emperor Menelik II ordered the introduction of bahir zaf (blue gum) to try and replace the native vegetation that was disappearing around many settlements. These trees have since covered much of the Ethiopian highlands and, while they are important for our timber trade, recent studies have shown that they have a damaging effect on the soil and that there is a reduced biodiversity of other plants in areas of bahir zaf vegetation. But apart from these efforts, we have used our vegetation in Ethiopia without thought or co-ordinated conservation efforts for many years. Vegetation should be a sustainable resource \u2013 plants make more plants and grow continuously, so we can harvest them. But no area of vegetation can withstand rapid harvesting without replanting and conservation. It seems that originally around 35% of Ethiopia was covered in forests and lush vegetation. By 1952 only 16% of that forest cover was left.\nBy 1980 this was down to 3.6%, 2.7% by 1987 and in 1990 only 2.4% of our beautiful country had forest cover \u2013 we had lost most of what is one of the most biodiverse ecosystems in the world. Only a very few forests, such as the Anabe and Yegof forests in Wello and the Menagesha forest in Shewa, are well preserved. Scientists think that the way in which land has traditionally been held communally, with no one responsible for the long-term sustainability of the resources, is at least part of the problem. A lack of accountability and responsibility has led to excess felling, woodland and plantation fires, etc. However, there is an increasing awareness in our country of the need to conserve what remains of our magnificent vegetation and where possible restore and preserve it.",

The Government of Ethiopia is working with many different groups to encourage the replanting of land with endemic species. Research institutions are looking at indigenous knowledge and using local practices of looking after resources. Much research into our native plants is going on, and more care taken when introducing exotic plants. The National Herbarium at Addis Ababa has become a world-class institution holding information about Ethiopian plants.

Our bees provide the honey for a thriving export business and for the production of tej.

There have been many moves in Ethiopia in recent years to conserve our wildlife, and we will be looking at some of these in detail. Conservation involves protecting habitats and managing populations. Another method involves preventing the spread of disease. For example, in the areas where there are still breeding groups of Ethiopian wolves, scientists work hard to keep domestic dogs vaccinated against dangerous diseases such as rabies. When there was an outbreak of rabies in the Web Valley in 2004, the Ethiopian Wolf Conservation Programme captured and vaccinated 72 wolves. This contained and reduced the damage the disease would otherwise have done to these precious populations \u2013 and made the local dogs healthier too.\nMany of the conservation points which we will discuss for animals apply to vegetation as well. Ethiopia is one of the most enlightened of the African countries in its approach to conservation. In particular, we have set up and maintain a number of National Parks. A National Park is a relatively large area of land which is owned by the Government and is set aside for the protection of vegetation and wildlife and for their appreciation by human beings. A National Park should contain several ecosystems which are not affected by human activities. It is protected legally and there should be staff (rangers) who manage and protect the environment. Visitors can enter the National Parks under carefully controlled conditions for educational, cultural and leisure reasons. Any natural resources within a National Park should not be exploited, although sometimes there may be a need for some building work, and some populations may need to be managed by selective culling to keep the numbers manageable and avoid damaging the ecosystem. When this is necessary, hunting licences may be issued to raise money to help support the park.\nBy careful management in National Parks, many animals and plants are conserved in Ethiopia and the work is continuing, with local populations becoming more and more involved in protecting our great wildlife diversity. There are some problems \u2013 it is not always easy for people to live within a National Park, and some people continue to poach and kill animals even when they are protected. But on the whole, we are making good progress.\nBelow are listed many of the main National Parks of Ethiopia along with some of the wildlife sanctuaries that have been set up to protect specific species. In each case you can learn about some of the common species of wildlife that exist in each conservation area.\nAbijatta-Shalla Lakes National Park is 200 km south of Addis Ababa and it is 887 km2 in size. More than half of the area is under water in Lake Abijatta and Lake Shalla, but it also includes peaks like Mount Fike, which is 2075 m above sea level. Animals which are found in this beautiful park include flamingos, Great White Pelicans, Grant\u2019s Gazelle, Oribi Warthog and Golden Jackals.\nAwash National Park is found about 225 km east of Addis Ababa and its southern boundary is formed by the Awash river. Much of it is at an altitude of around 900 m, but it contains a dormant volcano called Fantale which is over 2000 m high. The park is relatively dry, with lots of grassland and acacia woodland. The wildlife supported by this terrain is very varied. There are Beisa oryx, Soemmerrings Gazelle and of course wild pigs. Zebra, dik-dik, Anubis and Hamadryas Baboons, cheetahs, serval and leopards can all be found in this area. The birdlife is also extravagant and varied, including ostriches, Secretary Birds, Carmine Bee-eaters and the Abyssinian Roller.\nBale Mountain National Park is not always easy to get to but it contains a mixture of forest and moorland, and some very rare animals such as the Gelada Baboon, Mountain Nyala and Ethiopian wolves. Other species found there include the Giant Mole Rat, Klipspringer, Menelik\u2019s Bushbuck and warthogs.\nGambela National Park is one of our newest National Parks. It is big \u2013 over 5000 km2 \u2013 with massive grassland plains and it includes the Baro river. The wildlife that can be seen in this park includes enormous Nile perch, crocodiles and hippos as well as waterbuck, Roan Antelope, hyena, lions, elephants, buffalo, zebra, Vervet Monkeys and black-and-white colobus monkeys.\nRift Valley Lakes National Park is in a chain of seven lakes which run from Debre Zeit towards Kenya. This National Park does have some mammals, including Grant\u2019s Gazelle and warthogs, but the wildlife for which it is famous is the birdlife, which includes Greater and Lesser Flamingos, a huge colony of Great White Pelicans, fish eagles, spoonbills, Abdim\u2019s Storks and ibises.\nMago National Park has an area of over 2000 km2. Almost 800 km south-west of Addis Ababa on the east bank of the Omo river, this National Park is largely grassland with some forest around the rivers. It is home to 56 species of our famous plains animals, including giraffe, elephants, lions, buffalo, cheetah, zebra, leopard and oryx. This is one of the remaining places where rare Black Rhinos may be found. Vultures are one of the well-known bird species in this area.\nOmo National Park is very big indeed, covering over 4000 km2. Over 300 species of birds alone are found here. Animal life includes kudu, hartebeest, oryx, Anubis Baboons, lions, cheetahs, buffalo, giraffes and elephants.\nNechisar National Park is between two lakes, Abaya and Chamo. The habitats include dry bush, savannah and a groundwater forest and, although it is only about 500 km2, almost 200 species of birds have been recorded here, including Red-billed Hornbills, fish eagles, the Abyssinian Ground-hornbill and the Kori Bustard! Animals which can be seen include crocodiles, Burchell\u2019s Zebra, bushbucks, Grey Duiker, Grant\u2019s Gazelle and the Greater Kudu. This National Park is very important for the conservation of the rare, endemic Swayne\u2019s Hartebeest.\nSimien Mountains National Park is home to both spectacular scenery and spectacular and rare wildlife. This major mountain range has been declared a World Heritage Site, and it has many peaks above 4000 m. This is not a hot area, and night temperatures are often cold. This is the area of Ethiopia where a number of our endemic species are protected and conserved. You can find Walia ibex, Ethiopian wolves and Gelada Baboons in this amazing and protected region of our country.\nYangudi Rassa National Park is big and is found in the arid northern Rift lowlands. There is a wide variety of vegetation, from semi-desert and scrubland to savannah and even open woodlands. In this conservation area you can find the wild-ass ancestor of our domestic donkeys, and Greater and Lesser Kudu, Grevy\u2019s Zebra and cheetah.\nWe also have a number of wildlife sanctuaries which are similar to National Parks but focus on the conservation of particular species. Some examples of these include:\nHarar Wildlife Sanctuary is an area of almost 7000 km2 in the Misraq Hararghe Zone of the Oromia region, which was set up to conserve and protect our native elephant sub-species, Loxodonta Africana oleansie. The area is also home to the black-maned lion.\nKuni-Muktar Mountain Nyala Sanctuary is a protected area which has been set up to protect the Mountain Nyala (Tragelaphus nyala), an extremely rare endemic animal in Ethiopia. There are fears that there are only between 70 and 200 of these animals left in Ethiopia, and so it is vital to conserve them. Sadly, there are still people in our country who want to hunt these animals for trophies, and so they need a great deal of protection.\nSenkelle Swayne\u2019s Hartebeest Sanctuary is close to the Lake Rift Valley National Park and it is dedicated to the protection of this rare hartebeest. There are over a thousand of these protected animals in the sanctuary.\nIn Ethiopia many people are working to conserve our vegetation and wildlife. On a large scale we have National Parks and wildlife sanctuaries. On a smaller scale many individuals and villages are working to conserve the environment. For our country to succeed, people must be able to live side by side with our great Ethiopian biodiversity of vegetation and wildlife in a sustainable way.",

        "chunk_text": "Air pollution comes in various forms, each of which has serious implications for our health and well-being as well as for the whole environment.\nOne type of air pollution is smoke produced by burning fuel for energy. Much of the fuel we use is fossil fuel \u2013 coal, oil or gas, or electricity produced by burning them. Fossil fuels contain chemicals known as hydrocarbons. When these fuels are burnt, tiny particles of unburnt hydrocarbons are released into the air. Diesel smoke is a good example of this. The particles are very small pieces of matter. This type of pollution is sometimes referred to as \u2018black carbon\u2019 pollution. The exhaust from burning fuels in cars, homes and industries is a major source of pollution in the air. Even the burning of wood on our fires can release significant quantities of soot into the air causing local air pollution. Smoke pollution worldwide is thought to be causing global dimming, blocking out some of the light from the sun.\nAnother major cause of air pollution is the production of carbon dioxide. Carbon dioxide is produced by living organisms as a waste product of respiration. It is used by plants in the process of photosynthesis. Carbon dioxide is also produced as a result of burning wood and fossil fuels.\nFor millions of years the levels of carbon dioxide released by living things into the atmosphere have been matched by the plants taking it out and the gas dissolving in the seas. As a result the level in the air stayed about the same from year to year. You learnt about this carbon cycle in grade 9.",

        "chunk_text": "But now the amount of carbon dioxide produced is increasing fast as the result of human activities. Around the world people are burning huge amounts of fossil fuels in cars, planes and also in power stations to generate electricity. This speed means that the natural sinks cannot cope, and so the levels of carbon dioxide are building up.\nCarbon dioxide in the atmosphere is important because of the greenhouse effect. It traps some of the heat from the sun and keeps the surface of the Earth warm enough for life as we know it. But the build-up of carbon dioxide gas in the atmosphere from human activities seems to be adding to this greenhouse effect and causing global warming. Although plants take in carbon dioxide and release oxygen, the release of carbon dioxide from human activities is higher than the plants can process. The situation is made worse because all around the world large-scale deforestation is taking place. We are cutting down trees over vast areas of land for timber and to clear the land for farming. In this case, the trees are felled and burned in what is known as \u2018slash-and-burn\u2019 farming. The land produced is only fertile for a short time, after which more forest is destroyed. No trees are planted to replace those cut down.\nDeforestation increases the amount of carbon dioxide released into the atmosphere as burning the trees leads to an increase in carbon dioxide levels from combustion. The dead vegetation left behind decays as it is attacked by decomposing micro-organisms, which releases more carbon dioxide.\nNormally trees and other plants use carbon dioxide in photosynthesis. They take it from the air and it gets locked up in plant material like wood for years. So when we destroy trees we lose a vital carbon dioxide \u2018sink\u2019. Dead trees don\u2019t take carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere.\nMethane is another greenhouse gas that causes air pollution and the levels of this gas are rising too. It has two major sources. As rice grows in swampy conditions, known as paddy fields, methane is released. Rice is the staple diet of many countries so as the population of the world has grown so has the farming of rice.\nThe other source of methane is cattle. Cows produce methane during their digestive processes and release it at regular intervals. In recent years the number of cattle raised to produce cheap meat for fast food like burgers has grown enormously, and so the levels of methane in the atmosphere are rising. Many of these cattle are raised on farms produced by deforestation.",

This in turn may have many effects on our climate and health \u2013 and it is also thought to contribute to the increased hurricane activity which has affected some areas of the world in recent times.\nAnother air pollutant is carbon monoxide, also produced by the burning of fossil fuels. It is produced by cars as well as by home water heaters, paraffin lamps and fires if they are not functioning properly. Carbon monoxide is very dangerous because it combines irreversibly with haemoglobin in your blood, reducing the oxygen-carrying capacity. There is carbon monoxide in cigarette smoke, which is why it is so dangerous to smoke if you are pregnant because you can deprive your unborn baby of oxygen. Carbon monoxide poisoning can eventually lead to death and, because the gas has no colour or smell, there is no way of knowing if it is leaking into your home from a faulty lamp.",

        "chunk_text": "Acid rain is the result of another form of air pollution. When fossil fuels are burned carbon dioxide is released into the atmosphere as a waste product. However, carbon dioxide is not the only waste gas produced. Fossil fuels often contain sulphur impurities. When these burn they react with oxygen to form sulphur dioxide gas. At high temperatures, for example, in car engines, nitrogen oxides are also released into the atmosphere.\nSulphur dioxide and nitrogen oxides pollute the air and can cause serious breathing problems for people if the concentration gets too high. They form a haze of pollution known as smog, which can be a real problem in big cities where there are millions of motor vehicles. They are also involved in the formation of acid rain. This pollutes land and water over a wide area. The sulphur dioxide and nitrogen oxides dissolve in the rain and react with oxygen in the air to form dilute sulphuric acid and nitric acid. This makes the rain more acidic \u2013 it is known as acid rain.",

        "topic": "The effect of acid rain",
        "chunk_text": "Not surprisingly, acid rain has a damaging effect on the environment. If it falls onto trees, the acid rain can cause direct damage. It may kill the leaves and, as it soaks into the soil, even the roots of the tree may be destroyed. In some parts of the world, huge areas of woodland are dying as a result of acid rain.\nAcid rain has an indirect effect on our environment as well as its very direct effect on plants such as trees. As acid rain falls into lakes, rivers and streams the water in them becomes acidic. If the concentration of acid gets too high, plants and animals can no longer survive. Many lakes and streams have become dead, no longer able to support life.\nIt is not only living things that are damaged by acid rain. The weak acid attacks the material of buildings and statues, reacting with any calcium carbonate (limestone or marble) and even with metals.\nAcid rain is a difficult form of air pollution to pin down and control. It is formed by pollution from factories. It also comes from the cars and other vehicles we use every day. The source of the gases is pretty widespread. The worst effects of acid rain are often not felt by the country that produced the pollution in the first place. The sulphur and nitrogen oxides are carried high in the air by the prevailing winds. As a result, it is often relatively \u2018clean\u2019 countries that get the pollution and the acid rain from their dirtier neighbours. Their own clean air goes on to benefit someone else!",

        "topic": "Air pollution in our homes",
        "chunk_text": "It may surprise you to learn that air pollution also needs to be considered inside our homes, offices and schools. Some of these pollutants can be created by indoor activities such as smoking and cooking. Fumes from cars come in through the windows. And when the air is polluted, whether inside or out, you cannot avoid breathing it in. One particular problem is air pollution in the home from the use of paraffin lamps to give us light in the evening. Burning paraffin produces many poisonous chemicals in the air including benzene, carbon monoxide and lead from the wick as well as particles of soot. We may breathe these substances into our lungs every day. Air pollution can affect our health in many ways with both short-term and long-term effects. Examples of short-term effects include irritation to the eyes, nose and throat, and upper respiratory infections such as bronchitis and pneumonia. Other symptoms can include headaches, nausea and allergic reactions. Long-term health effects of air pollution can include chronic respiratory disease, lung cancer, heart disease and even damage to the brain, nerves, liver or kidneys. Young children are particularly vulnerable. In some cases the pollution of the air in our homes can lead to death. In some places people are using solar power to store electricity during the day, which can then be used at night. This is a safe and pollution-free way of lighting our homes.\nAnother form of air pollution has led to the depletion of the ozone layer in the atmosphere. Ozone is a gas which is found in the atmosphere of the Earth. It absorbs some of the ultraviolet radiation from the sun. Ultraviolet radiation damages and burns the skin and can cause the development of skin cancers. The ozone layer protects life on Earth from the worst of this damage. For over 50 years people, particularly in the more economically developed countries, used chemicals called CFCs (chlorofluorocarbons) in fridges and freezers as a refrigerant, and in aerosol sprays as the propellant. They did not realise that CFCs can damage the ozone layer. By the time scientists made this discovery, it was too late. Air pollution by CFCs had caused the ozone layer around the Earth to get thinner, particularly over the Antarctic at certain times of the year. This thin area is often referred to as the \u2018ozone hole\u2019. Levels of ultraviolet light reaching the surface of the Earth have increased as a result and levels of skin cancers and eye problems caused by ultraviolet light have also increased. However, once people realised the damage this was doing, the use of CFCs has been banned and fridges and freezers containing these compounds are disposed of very carefully. Within about 50 years the ozone hole will heal itself \u2013 already levels of atmospheric ozone are higher again. This is one form of air pollution that has been overcome. People have become more aware of the problems caused by air pollution. In many countries in the world steps are being taken to stop the damage to our environment from air pollution. One of the biggest causes of air pollution is cars and other vehicles. Car exhausts contain carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, sulphur dioxide and oxides of nitrogen. All of these gases have both a direct and an indirect effect on human health. Around the world people are working hard to reduce the levels of sulphur dioxide and nitrogen oxides in car exhausts. More and more cars are being fitted with catalytic converters. Once hot, these remove the acidic gases before they are released into the air.",

        "topic": "Preventing air pollution in Ethiopia",
        "chunk_text": "In Ethiopia we do not contribute greatly to air pollution as our way of life is often relatively simple. Relatively few people own cars, and the majority of people cook and heat their homes using traditional fuels such as wood or animal dung. However, burning forests down during deforestation has a bad effect on air pollution levels. In Ethiopian towns and cities, more air pollution is produced than in the countryside. As more people move to cities, the number of vehicles increases and the use of electricity and fuels such as kerosene for cooking also increases. It is important that we take care to keep our pollution levels as low as possible. For example, the use of solar energy to charge batteries so that we can light our homes with clean electricity in the evenings reduces the risk of air pollution from paraffin lamps. This is an important step we can take to protect the health of our children \u2013 and it reduces the risk of fires as well. In the meantime, we have to live with the effects of climate change and ozone depletion that is the result of air pollution elsewhere in the world. Many countries are passing laws which control the amount of air pollution that is allowed by factories and the generation of electricity. People are trying to prevent many types of air pollution, through personal, careful, attention to our interactions with the environment. Individuals can make a difference by reducing the amount of electricity they use, by switching off lights when they are not needed and reducing the level of the air conditioning. People walk or cycle sometimes instead of using cars or buses. In cities people buy local produce with as little packaging as possible \u2013 that reduces the fuel used to get food to them, and the chemicals processed to make the packaging. All of these things can make a real difference in the long term, and the more people who help the better. Here in Ethiopia we have a relatively clean country \u2013 let us all work hard to keep it that way, and to conserve our wonderful vegetation and wildlife, so that we can be an example to the world.",
