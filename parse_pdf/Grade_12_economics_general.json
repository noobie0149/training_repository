        "chunk_text": "Over about 100 years, the Ethiopian economy has experienced changes from market-oriented to centrally planned and back again to a market-oriented economy. Under the Monarchy (up to 1974), the economy was primarily agricultural. The economy was based on a feudal system under which land ownership was highly inequitable with major portions of farmland being in the hands of wealthy landlords of the very few industries, most were owned by foreigners. During the Military Regime (1974 \u2013 1991), the economy shifted to a command economy where socialist principles and ideologies ruled. Substantial land reforms were introduced in the agricultural, industrial and financial sectors. The government owned all the large-scale manufacturing industries, banks and insurance companies. In spite of all these measures, the regime failed to solve Ethiopia\u2019s multifaceted problems. Finally, it ceased to rule in 1991 when the EPRDF marched into Addis Ababa on May 28th, 1991. Since the assumption of power by EPRDF (1991), its government has followed a market-oriented economy. It has supported a process of economic reforms based on privatization of state enterprises, promotion of agricultural exports and deregulation (move towards free market) of the economy. This move has facilitated significant sectoral growth performances.",

        "chunk_text": "For decades, agriculture has been the backbone of the Ethiopian economy. Hence its performance determines the economic well-being of the people. Also, many other economic activities, including transportation and manufacturing, rely heavily on the agricultural sector. Main Features of the Agricultural Sector Agriculture contributes about 45% of the overall GDP of the country; generates more than 80% of export earnings; employs about 85% of the population; and supplies about 70% of raw materials to the secondary activities (Central Statistics Office, 2006). The agricultural sector produces both crops and livestock. The crops produced include food crops, cash crops, fruits, and vegetables. It constitutes the greatest share of the country\u2019s GDP and export earnings when compared to the livestock production. The main crops are: Cereals (teff, barley, maize, wheat, sorghum and millet) Pulses (horse beans, vetch, lentils, etc) Oil seeds (viger seed, flax, rape seed, seasame, castor beans and soyabeans) Cash and industrial crops (coffee, oil seeds, pulses, cotton, sisal tobacco, etc.) Recent developments: Crop production and productivity in both volume of production and yield per hectare have shown consistent increases for almost all categories of main crops during the last few years. Diversification of agricultural production. Establishment of an agricultural marketing system. Development of research and extension services. Improvement in the supply of agricultural inputs. Expansion of small-and medium-scale irrigation. Better management of natural resources. Major problems of the sector: Frequent drought. Soil degradation largely caused by overgrazing and overpopulation. Land fragmentation. Prevalence of backward agricultural practices. Poor marketing facilities due to poor road networks, etc. Rapidly increasing prices of agricultural inputs like fertilizers etc.",

        "chunk_text": "The Ethiopian industrial sector has been small compared to the agricultural and service sectors. This could be due to the short history of industrialization in the country. Its growth was modest, not exceeding 6.7 percent for the last four decades except during the years from 1997/98 to 2009/2010. The industrial sector is dominated by three sub-sectors: manufacturing (38%), construction (25%), and electric and water supply (18%). The remaining sub-sectors, electricity, mining and quarrying, etc., constitute the remaining 19%. Main Features of the Industrial Sector \u2018 The sector contributes about 13% of GDP and 9.5% of employment. \u2018 There are about 130 state-owned and 7,000 private manufacturing industries of all sizes, mainly engaged in the production of consumer goods. Main products of these manufacturing industries include: textiles, foodstuffs, tobacco, beverages, cement, leather and leather products, wood, metallic and non-metallic products, paper, plastic, tiles, clothing/apparel, canned and frozen meat, sugar and molasses, oil cakes and petroleum products. \u2018 The growth performance of the industrial sector saw an appreciable improvement in recent years, compared to the average growth rate of 6.7% over the 10 years 2001/02 - 2009/10. Looking at the growth performance of each sub-sector, the construction sector registered the highest growth rate between 2002 - 2010. It averaged about 13% per year in 2006 - 2010, compared to only 4.6% between 1991/92 and 2005/06. Large-and medium-scale industries recorded the second highest growth rates. Major problems in the sector: Low industrial base Low productivity level Underutilization of capacity Shortages of foreign exchange, new investment, raw materials and spare parts Very low level of technology/high dependence on imported technology Low-level skills and management Recent developments: Privatization of state enterprises Liberalization of investment regulations to attract foreign investment Tax incentives for potential investors Modernisation of the technological base through technology transfer agreements Establishment of industrial estates Implementation of training program for managers and technicians, both in the country and abroad Establishment of research and development (R & D) institutes Establishment of the National Network of Information System to ensure the flow of industrial information among different users Improvement of the National Standards Regulation System Development of infrastructure, including transportation and telecommunications.",

More specifically, the service sector includes: wholesale and retail trade, hotels and restaurants, transport and communication, banking and insurance, public administration and defence, education, health, domestic and other services. The Ethiopian service sector had the second highest share in GDP next to agriculture in the years preceding (2011); however, its contribution during the year 2008/09 was the highest. Main Features of the Services Sector The sector\u2019s share in GDP was 45.1% during 2008/09. A relatively small percentage of population (about 10%) has been engaged in the services sector. The large contribution of the sector to the GDP comes mostly from government employment. Significant achievements have been made in areas of health, trade, tourism, banking and insurance in the past few years. Growth Performance: The growth in the services sector has been significant following the reform carried out in the early 1990s. Consequently its growth rate and hence its share in GDP has progressively increased during the last two decades. From Table 1.3 we can see that higher growth trends are observed in the sub-sectors of Trade, Hotels and Restaurants, Transportation and Communication as well as in Banking and Insurance.",

Farmers produce a variety of grains, including wheat, teff, sorghum, corn, and millet. Coffee, a cash crop, grows well on southern slopes. Herders raise cattle, sheep and goats in nearly all parts of the country. Additionally, Ethiopia possesses several valuable minerals including gold and platinum. Ethiopia is also one of the few African countries with the potential to produce hydroelectric and geothermal power. Furthermore, it has regions where dense forests exist, and its many lakes, rivers, reservoirs and their coastlines are fertile fishing grounds.

        "chunk_text": "Population is an important resource of a country since it determines the quantity and quality of available labour and entrepreneurship \u2013 the two important factors of production. As per the estimates of July 2009, the population of Ethiopia numbers 85.2 million. Since 1984, three approximately decennial Population Censuses (1984, 1994 and 2007) have been conducted by the Central Statistical Authority (CSA) which have given a more clear idea about Ethiopia\u2019s population and its structure. The total number of persons enumerated in the third Population Census, aggregating the May and November data sets, was 73,918,505. Of these, 37,296,657 (50.5%) were males and 36,621,848 (49.5%) were females. The population of the country in the previous censuses of 1984 and 1994 were 39,868,572 and 53,477,265, respectively. Each successive population census has demonstrated that national population size increased in steady increments of significant proportions. For instance, a comparison of the 2007 census results with those from 1994 shows that the population of the country had increased by more than 20 million over the 12 years. Similarly, in the previous decade (1984 to 1994), the population of the country increased by 13.6 million. Population Growth The 2007 population census results show that the population of Ethiopia grew at an average annual rate of 2.6 percent between 1997 and 2007 \u2013 a decrease of 0.2% from the annual growth rate during the previous period (1984 \u2013 1994). The highest annual growth rate for the period 1994 \u2013 2007 was observed for Gambella Region (4.1%), followed by Benishangul-Gumuz (3.0%), SNNP and Oromia (2.9%). Population Composition by Sex (gender) Sex composition is one of the basic characteristics of a population. Sex composition is very important for any analysis, as data on sex provides useful information about reproductive potential, human resources, level of school attendance by each sex, and so on. As shown in Table 1.5, male population is slightly higher (50.5%) than female population (49.5%) at the national level. Sex composition of the population by region shows variation: in Afar, Somali and Gambella, the number of males exceeds that of females (no change from 1994 census results), while in Addis Ababa the number of females is considerably higher than the number of males. Population Composition by Age Age composition is the other basic demographic characteristic of population. Age data are useful for demographic analysis, for various types of socio-economic development planning, and for analysis of labour market and unemployment level of any country. The age-sex structure of the a population is usually depicted graphically by a population pyramid. It is determined by the effects of past fertility, mortality and migration. The broad base of the population pyramids depicted above shows that a significant proportion of the national population is below age 15, a pattern also observed in the 1994 census. The distribution of the national population by broad age groups depicted in the above figure shows that the proportion of young population under age 15 declined from 49.8 percent in 1984 to 45.0 percent in 2007. Conversely, the proportion of population in the working-age group (15-64) increased from 50.2 percent in 1984 to 51.9 percent in 2007. The proportion of population aged 65 years and over was 3.4 percent in 1984 and remained constant at 3.2 percent, according to both the 1994 and the 2007 census. In general, there was no significant change percentage-wise in the population of elderly persons between 1984, 1994, and 2007. Population Composition by Sex on Urban /Rural Bases Some Other Factors Affecting the Size and Growth of Population Fertility, mortality, international migration, etc., are some of the important factors that affect the size and growth of the population of a country. Relevant figures are listed below to indicate the population growth, considering the 1984 and 1994 censuses. When we observe the basic features of the population of Ethiopia \u2013 size, growth, composition, etc., the country has a relatively high growth rate, high infant mortality rate, low life expectancy and high dependency rate. In order to sustain the process of economic development, it has to restrain population growth. In this context, the government recently included a population component in its overall development program. Also, a national population policy has been formulated which aims at narrowing the gap between high population growth and low economic growth and at the reduction of maternal, infant and child morbidity and mortality rates. Dependency ratio is the ratio or proportion of economically inactive age-group to the economically active age-group. Economically inactive age group (children + old aged) Dependency ratio = \u00d7100 Economically active age group (Adult) 45%+3.2% DR = \u00d7100 51.9% 48.2% = \u00d7100=93% 51.9% The age dependency ratio of Ethiopia in 2007 is calculated to be 93%. This means that for every 100 persons in the working age group, there are about 93% dependants. In other words, every person in the working age group has nearly one dependent.",

In the context of agriculture, land here refers not only to areal extent, but to its productivity of food crops and other crops. It is known that Ethiopia has a total area of 1,104,300 square kilometers of which 35 percent is considered suitable for agriculture. The availability of this much land for agricultural purposes is directly or indirectly the result of good soil and suitable climates for the performance of agriculture. As far as the types of soil is concerned, most of the highlands have two main soil types that are generally believed to be suitable for agriculture. These soil types are: Red-to-reddish brown soils: These soil types are well endowed with needed minerals for crops and they are found in areas of relatively good drainage. Further, these soil types are friable \u2013 easy for ploughing . Brownish-to-grey and black soils with high clay content. With proper drainage and conditioning, these soils have excellent agricultural potentials. Regarding the climatic aspect, the formation of different agro-ecological zones due to altitude has multiplied the resource potential of the land of Ethiopia. The presence of different agro-climate zones results in the growth of different crops that increases Ethiopia\u2019s exportable items for earning foreign currency.",

        "chunk_text": "Ethiopia has the largest livestock population in Africa. The livestock sub-sector is estimated to account for 10% of the GDP and provides employment to over 30% of the agricultural labour force. The activity in the sector has grown since the government ended its monopoly on livestock trading in 1999, thereby encouraging local and foreign private investments in ranches, meat processing, and abattoirs. Livestock and livestock by products generate income in foreign currency in addition to serving local consumption. However, despite some improvement in recent years, especially in terms of an encouraging policy and strategy for the export of livestock and livestock products, the sector still remains under exploited. Livestock Population The official estimate by the CSA shows that there were about 43 million cattle in 2006/07. As 99.4 percent of the total cattle in the country are local breeds, the proportion of hybrid and exotic breeds is small. The predominant cattle breed found in Ethiopia is Zebu. The main cattle breeds identified and characterized so far include the Borena, Fogera, Horo, Sheko (Gimira), Abigar (Nuer), and the Afar. These main cattle breeds are indigenous to the respective regions of Ethiopia. Ethiopia also has a large number of sheep and goats. There are 41 million head of cattle, 25 million sheep, 23 million goats, 41 million chickens, 5.7 million equines and 2.3 million camels distributed in all the administrative regions. With respect to the type of breed, almost all of the sheep and goats are indigenous. So far, some seven and about twelve breeds/populations of sheep and goats, respectively, have been identified in Ethiopia. Data on poultry population indicate that the country has about 41 million poultry of different varieties. About 95 percent of the poultry are known to be indigenous, while the remaining are hybrid and exotic. Livestock Products It was estimated that 2.63 million liters of cow\u2019s milk and 114.18 liters of camel\u2019s milk were produced from rural sedentary and resettlement areas of the country in 2006/07. Annual egg production in 2006/07 was estimated to be 81.7 million. Estimates also show that 51 million kilograms of honey were produced in 2006/07 from 4.9 million beehives. Despite the huge livestock resource and the important role expected of livestock, the livestock sub-sector of the country is characterized by low productivity and production. To conclude, we may say Ethiopia has a large number of livestock with considerable potential to contribute to the national economy if adequate attention is given to developing the subsector. Livestock Development The constraints that hindered livestock development can be broadly categorized as: Environmental \u2013 the presence of diseases like, Tsetsefly, etc. that kill thousands of cattle every year. Technical \u2013 shortage of trained personnel to guide and use dairy farms as well as to fatten the cattle. Infrastructural \u2013 lack of water supply and road networks to transport the cattle to the required destinations in a timely way with less exhaustion of the livestock. Institutional \u2013 shortage of veterinary and other services for the rearing of better quality livestock.",

Furthermore, a study reported that only 15,389 tons were actually caught in 2001. The fishery sub-sector of the economy is estimated to contribute only about 1% of the gross domestic product. In the post-1974 period, government encouraged the establishment of fishery associations and cooperatives along the Red Sea coast and in the Great Rift Valley lakes area. In 1978 the government established the Fish Production and Marketing Corporation (FPMC) to help improve the Ethiopian fish industry. Under the current government, with financial aid from the United Nations Development, the second Five-Year Agricultural Development Plan (2001-2005) also laid down a number of targets to improve the yield of Ethiopia\u2019s fisheries, but still a number of problems remain to be overcome.

        "chunk_text": "In the late nineteenth century, about 30% of Ethiopia was covered with forests. The clearing of land for agricultural use and the cutting of trees for fuel gradually changed the scene, and today forest areas have dwindled to about 3% of country\u2019s total land. An estimated 3.5 million hectares of natural forest presently remains in 58 areas designated as National Forest Priority Areas (NFPA). Of these, 13 are managed under integrated forest management systems, with about 80,000 hectares of industrial forest having being established for limited sustainable exploitation. Economic Significance of Forestry Lumber from the coniferous forests is important to the construction industry. The broad-leaved evergreen forests furnish timber that is used in construction and in the production of plywood. The woodlands are major sources of firewood and charcoal. Certain trees \u2013 boswellia and species of commiphora \u2013 are of special economic significance. Both grow in the arid lowlands and produce gums that are the bases for frankincense and myrrh. A species of acacia found in several parts of the country is a source of gum arabic used in the manufacturing of adhesives, pharmaceutical products, and confectionery. The eucalyptus, an exotic tree introduced in the late nineteenth century and grown mainly near urban areas, is a valuable source of telephone and telegraph poles, tool handles, furniture, and firewood. It is also a major source of the material from which fiber-board and particleboard are made. Forest Conservation Efforts by the Government Before 1974 about half of the forestland was privately owned or claimed to be owned, and roughly half was held by the government. There was little government control on forestry. The 1975 land reform nationalized forestland and sawmills, which existed mostly in the south. The government controlled harvesting of forestland. But this measure encouraged illegal logging and accelerated the destruction of Ethiopia\u2019s remaining forests. To ensure that conservation activity conformed with government policy and directives on land use, reforestation programmes were organized through the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development or district offices that planned, coordinated, and monitored all work. Reforestation programs resulted in the planting of millions of seedlings in community forests throughout the country. A variety of non-government organizations, which had to organize their activities through local peasant associations, supplemented government efforts to rehabilitate the country\u2019s forests. Later on, the Ethiopian Forestry Action Plan (EFAP) was launched to improve woodland conservation, increase public participation in reforestation projects, and prevent further depletion of existing forest resources.",

        "chunk_text": "The Ethiopian energy sector can be classified into two sub-sectors: i traditional and ii modern The major traditional energy resources consist of fuel wood, crop residues, animal dung, and charcoal. These energy resources satisfy most of the energy needs of the country, and they are readily available and can be produced using traditional methods. However, except for the crop residues and animate energy, whose share is low, the main energy resources, i.e., wood and its by product, charcoal, are derived from forest resources which are continuously diminishing. As a result, the state of traditional fuel is on the road to destruction rather than development. The main modern energy source upon which Ethiopia depends is hydroelectric power. According to the available data, the country has a natural potential to generate about 30,000 megawatts of hydroelectric power annually. However, what has been developed amounted to only 2000 megawatts, in 2011, which was about less than 10% of the total potential. Of the total electric-power generating capacity of 706 MW in 2004, 94% or 663 MW were from water, while the remaining 43 MW were largely from diesel and, to a limited extent, from geothermal resources. In addition to this, because Ethiopia is geographically situated in the tropics, it gets a lot of annual sunshine and longdays of sunlight, and thus is blessed with a great deal of solar energy. But unfortunately this energy resource has not yet been developed much. Another potential of Ethiopian commercial energy resources are oil and bio-gas. As of 2011, all the oil that the country consumed was imported. The demand for it has also increased over time. The amount of oil products imported in 1992/93 was 555 thousand tons. This import had reached 1.1 million-tons by the year 2002. Although petroleum explorations undertaken so far have not yet shown concrete results, it is believed that the country has other source of fossil fuel resources; Ethiopia has a proven deposit of about 100 billion cubic meters of natural gas and over 200 million tons of coal. Although efforts have been made over the past few years to develop these energy resources, and attempts are still underway, no concrete results have been achieved as yet.",

The third plan\u2019s objectives: Raising manufacturing and agro-industrial performance. Expansion of educational opportunities. Improvement in peasant agriculture. The Second Five-Year Plan and the Third Five-Year Plan anticipated that the economy would grow at an annual rate of 4.3 percent and 6.0 percent, respectively. But the Planning Commission never assessed the performance of these two plans, largely because of a shortage of qualified personnel. However, according to data from the Central Statistical Authority, from 1960/61 to 1973/74 the economy achieved sustained economic growth. Between 1960 and 1970, for example, Ethiopia enjoyed an annual average growth rate of 4% in per-capita gross domestic product. The manufacturing sector\u2019s growth rate more than doubled (from 1.9 percent in 1960/61 to 4.4 % in 1973/74), and the growth rate for the wholesale, retail trade, transportation, and communication sectors increased from 9.3 percent to 15.6 percent. By the early 1970s, Ethiopia\u2019s economy not only had started to grow but also had begun to diversify into areas such as manufacturing and services. However, these changes failed to improve the lives of most Ethiopians. This failure could be attributed to the feudal land tenure system that deprived millions of rural peasants from the right to appropriate land and other resources. This deprivation resulted in the decline of production and outbreaks of riots against the system.",

        "chunk_text": "The 1974 revolution by the Derg resulted in the establishment of a socialist state which aimed at the nationalization and restructuring of the Ethiopian economy. Economic planning and development in the post-revolution period had four distinct phases. i 1974-78: During this period there was little economic growth. Instead, the government\u2019s nationalization measures and the highly unstable political climate caused economic dislocation in sectors such as agriculture and manufacturing. Additionally, the military budget consumed a substantial portion of the nation\u2019s resources. As a result of these problems, gross domestic product increased at only an average annual rate of 0.4%. ii 1978-80: During this period, the economy began to recover as the government consolidated power and implemented institutional reforms. The government\u2019s new Development Through Cooperation Campaign (commonly referred to as zemecha) also contributed to the economy\u2019s improvement. Consequently, gross domestic product grew at an average annual rate of 5.7 percent. Benefiting from good weather, agricultural production increased at an average annual rate of 3.6 percent, and manufacturing increased at an average annual rate of 18.9 percent. iii 1980-85: Various annual development campaign programmes were implemented during this period, but still the economy experienced a setback \u2013 gross domestic product declined, manufacturing took a downturn, and agriculture reached a crisis stage. This happened because of four reasons: widespread drought all over the country, manufacturing sector stagnated as agricultural inputs declined, lack of foreign exchange and declining investment, and high rise in defence expenditure. iv 1985-90: The government prepared a ten-year perspective plan for the period 1984-94, which aimed at the development of agriculture, enhancement of exports, and improvement in the quality of livestock. To achieve this, strategies of cooperativisation and establishment of state farms, etc., were adopted. As a result, the agricultural decline was reversed and the manufacturing sector also grew. Gross domestic product increased at an average annual rate of 5 percent. However, the lingering effects of the 1984-85 drought undercut these achievements and contributed to the economy\u2019s overall stagnation during this period.",

For example, agriculture supplies the country with food grains, dairy and meat products. A productive agricultural sector provides relatively abundant food and raw materials to the population. Backward linkages: an efficient/productive agricultural sector supplies food and raw material to the industrial sector and its labour force. In turn, it has to be supplied with modern inputs and technologies to cope with responding to the growing demand of the non-farming and farming population. Without such support, the agriculture sector appears weak and non-supportive. It may even risk its own population facing food insecurity. Furthermore, productivity in the agricultural sector improves the level of income received by rural people. Increased income of rural people is believed to generate increased demand for manufactured goods from the industrial sector. Forward linkages: productivity in the agricultural sector can promote the following forward linkages. First, it reduces the cost of living in the industry-based/urban areas which, in turn, reduces the pressure on wages and makes industrial profit higher. Second, increasing the provision of raw materials reduces the cost of raw materials and makes industrial profits higher. These two factors can contribute significantly to increasing industrial savings and investment that leads to the promotion of the sector.",

The question is how much surplus should be transferred. In this regard, two opposing views can be discussed. One is that agriculture does not require large amounts of capital for its expansion. The other view is that the investment requirements for agricultural transformation are so large that there may be a need for a net flow of capital from non-agriculture to agriculture. The Derge regime removed a great deal of surplus from the agricultural sector to supply both the urban consumers and its huge army with cheap foodstuffs. However, this surplus was used ineffectively.

There rainfed crop production is not possible because of low-level erratic rainfall, and people rely more on livestock for subsistence. The lowlands are home to about 20% of Ethiopia\u2019s cattle, 25% of the sheep, and 73% of the goats, plus about one million camel. These animals support some 5.5 million people. In addition to feeding this population, the livestock in the range lands account for a major portion of the country\u2019s exports of live animals, in particular of cattle. Surplus sheep and goats sourced from the rangelands represent about 19% of the domestic supply. Ethiopia\u2019s range lands are also important for wildlife. The main areas of wildlife concentration are in the southwestern part of the country, particularly in the Omo River basin and the Gambella region. In these areas, which have a high rainfall and fertile soils, tsetse infestation has greatly suppressed agricultural and pastoral activities. Although less abundant, wildlife also exists in the eastern part of the country, particularly in the Awash Valley and in the southern rangelands. The conservation and development of these resources are carried out through the development of national parks, wildlife sanctuaries, and reserves. In addition, 14 controlled areas have been established, of which the largest is the Borena controlled hunting area. There is not much documented information about this system of farming. Most of the people are nomadic, moving seasonally, together with their livestock, from one place to another in search of pasture and water. Some studies have been undertaken about the pastoralists roaming in the Awash Valley, in connection the with development of medium-to large-scale irrigation schemes there. Livestock production is much greater than crop production in the pastoral nomadic system. General and empirical observations suggest that this system is characterized by chronic food shortages. Thus, agricultural products and productivity are extremely low. With the possible exception of livestock vaccination, there is virtually nothing that the government (or any other, non-governmental organization) has provided for long in terms of assistance or support to the pastoral-nomadic system.

        "chunk_text": "Commercial farming system was officially introduced during the third five-year plan (1968 \u2013 73) of the Imperial Government of Ethiopia. Among the strategies envisaged to modernize agriculture and increase marketable surplus, the plan stated that available government land would be utilised for the establishment of large commercial farms. As a result, many entrepreneurs rented and developed commercial farms in the Awash Valley, the Rift Valley and other areas. After the 1974 revolution, all these farms were confiscated by the government. Additional government lands in many parts of the country were also developed into large-scale state farms. These were organized into enterprises which in turn were grouped under corporations, according to their locations and output specialization. A separate ministry, the Ministry of State Farms Development was set up to manage and expand state farms. Also another separate ministry, the Ministry of Coffee and Tea Development, was established. The state farm enterprise introduced intensive farming and extensive mechanised agriculture. The former was based on irrigation, while the latter was marked by rainfed agriculture, with or without the use of fertilizers and other chemicals. It is based on bringing unused land, into cultivation a predominant feature of modern agriculture in Ethiopia prior to 1974. State farms have been the most pampered of all production systems in Ethiopia. There had been no limit for these farms in terms of receiving land, agricultural inputs, credits, price incentives and marketing facilities. Despite all these advantages, they were unproductive and inefficient. The major characteristics of many of them were mismanagement, abuse of assets, corruption, etc. It must be noted that some of these farms were developed without adequate studies, resulting in huge financial losses. In fact, most of the state farms were run on government financial resources. This system, comprising about 5% of the total cropland area, together with co-operatives, accounted for less than 10% of total agricultural production. The efficiency of state farms is extremely low, relative to the high expenditure made in establishing and operating them. The major crops grown in these farms include cotton, coffee, tea, sugarcane, fruits and vegetables. The size and role of state farms declined after 1992 when the new government granted some of the state farms to nearby farmers and investors. At present, there are only 13 state farms. They produce mainly wheat, maize, cotton, coffee, and tea on 156,040 hectares of land. Under the current economic policy attempted have been made establish commercial farms. Out of the total investment permits issued between 1992/93 and 1997/98, 1148 or 26.8% of them were in agriculture. However, only 508 projects became operational. With the advent of market economy, the Federal Government has recognized the decisive role that private capital can play in the expansion and development of large-scale modern farming in order to enhance the supply of food and raw materials and to create employment opportunities. As a result, the role of state farms is expected to fall significantly. The state may operate those state farms that are strategic to the economy, jointly with domestic or foreign private capital. In order to encourage domestic and foreign private capital, without any capital limitation, the government is committed to creating an enabling environment.",

The government took some fiscal measures to encourage the expansion of these farms in the country. Among the resulting policy measures were credit arrangements, tax holidays for the first five years for investments in excess of 200,000 Birr, low land use fees, tax-free import of heavy machinery, and possibilities of remitting profits to investor countries of origin. As a result, some foreign-owned profitable plantations developed. They mostly produced food and fiber. However, these results were too small to achieve the given incentives.

They were designed to supply important inputs such as chemicals, fertilizers, improved seeds, improved farm tools, credits, pesticides, and know-how. These inputs were for the purposes of: raising the living standard of the poor peasants by raising per-capita income; creating employment opportunities by encouraging labour-intensive technology; encouraging peasant participation in the development process to solve problems; expanding experimental stations for propagating new ideas in agricultural technology and providing improved farm tools. The criteria for selecting areas for such a package were the availability of adequate rainfall, good weather conditions, fertility of soil, the possibility that the areas are conductive for further expansion, etc. Accordingly, the Chilalo Agricultural Development Unit (CADU), the Welayita Agricultural Development Unit (WADU), and the Adaa District Development Package Project (ADDP) were established. These projects were sponsored by the Swedish International Development Agency (SIDA) and the United States Agency for International Development (USAID). Some achievements were observed in the project areas. For example, income of participating farmers increased by Birr 340 per year, productivity in crops and livestock increased significantly, and the adoption of modern inputs expanded in the project areas. But there were also some adverse effects, such as an an increase in the eviction of tenants. For example, in 1969 and 1970, over 500 tenant farmers were evicted from CADU. This means that the number of landless people increased. The other problem associated with these projects was their huge cost. At the start of the project, the cost per beneficiary farmer was Birr 15,000. Because of these problems, the comprehensive package project was too difficult to be duplicated in other areas of the country. Therefore, a relatively less costly package programme, known as the minimum package programme, was launched, substituting for the comprehensive package projects which covered larger areas.",

But, as with the comprehensive package projects, the benefits were poorly distributed in favour of landowners and large cultivators, and the eviction of tenants was still a problem in some areas. The second phase, MPP II, launched in the first half of the 1980s, continued well through the Military Regime.

This was followed by overall shifts in the economic policies of the country. State control of the economy was overextended. There were no circumstances in which private-sector participation in economic activity was encouraged. The new policy paradigm was manifested in the different sectors of the economy. The comprehensive and the minimum package projects launched during the Imperial regime continued in the Derg period. CADU was transformed into Arssi Rural Development Unit (ARDU) and then to Bale-Arssi Rural Development Unit (BARDU), which resulted in the thinning of resources over wide areas. Finally, all these projects were transformed into Peasant Agricultural Development Extension Projects (PADEP) which were organized along pluralist principles. Some of the objectives of PADEP included decentralization of the activities of the Ministry of Agriculture. These objectives resulted in the formulation of eight PADEP zones, each with its own plan, budget, administration, and research activities, but by 1988, PADEP came to an end due to shortage of funds and changes in administrative structure. The financing of PADEP was expected from international development agencies like the World Bank, SIDA and International Fund for Agriculture, upon conditions which would be fulfilled by the government of Ethiopia, such as the adoption of liberalization programmes. Research and feasibility studies were conducted by foreign experts especially by the World Bank. The government also organized the small holders along socialist lines for the purpose of the collective production and marketing of agricultural output and distribution of inputs. There were three types of associations, namely peasant associations, service cooperatives, and producers\u2019 cooperatives. By 1989 most peasant households were organized into 17,000 peasant associations, 3,700 service cooperatives, and 3,300 producers\u2019 cooperatives. But these associations could not help the farmers due to various problems, such as their inability to make decisions in their own affairs and the emphasis given to politics at the expense of everything else. These facts led to poor leadership and the embezzlement of funds. In general, the agricultural sector policies of the military government were characterized by the following: Nationalization of all private and commercial farms Prohibition of private investment in the agricultural sector Involuntary collectivisation of peasants into peasant associations, and into producers\u2019 and service cooperatives Forced villagization and settlements Government control of virtually all agricultural input and output markets Forced food-grain quota deliveries at predetermined low prices Restriction of the movement of agricultural outputs from one part of the country to another.

In earlier discussions, we said that agriculture is the dominant sector in the Ethiopian economy, accounting for about 45% of the GDP and employing close to 85% of the labour force. It is also the major source of foreign currency for the country. However, the performance of the sector has been unsatisfactory relative to the rapidly growing population. During the period of the Derg, especially from the years 1980/81 to 1990/91, the growth rate of the value added in agriculture and allied activities averaged a mere 1% per annum. Crop production and livestock rearing, forestry, and fishing exhibited annual average growth rates of 0.8, 2.6 and 4.6 percent, respectively, for the period. Besides population growth was about 2.9% per annum over the same period per capita agricultural value added increased at only a little less than 2% per annum. The sector did not register any significant improvements after the reform period. Between 1993/94 and 1999/2000, the average annual growth rate of value added in agriculture was only 1.8% while that of population growth was 2.9%. This value indicates the level to which the productivity of the agriculture sector is incompatible with population growth. The economic policy and strategy reforms of the 1990s positively influenced the performance of Ethiopian agriculture. Total production of food crops increased. However, the drought of 2002/03 weakened the capacity to produce food. In some parts of the country where agriculture has performed relatively better, drought has forced people to depend on food aid.",

A Food crops The food crops include grains, root and tuber crops, pulses and oil seeds. They are almost rain fed. Among the food crops, cereals are the most dominant in terms of areal coverage and total output. B Cash crops Cash crops are produced for the market in order to generate income. Ethiopian cash crops include coffee, chat, cotton, tea, cut flowers, etc. The three most important cash crops are coffee, chat and sugarcane. These days, the production of cut flowers is gaining importance. Coffee, chat and sugarcane were cultivated by about 1.5 million, 0.5 million, and 2.1 million farmers, respectively, in 2001/02. The average holding size was 0.062 ha per holder for chat, 0.021 ha per holder for sugarcane and 0.12 ha for coffee. The data shows that Chat producers apply more fertilizers and 11 percent of land is irrigated 29 percent of land under sugarcane cultivation is fertilized, while 27 percent of the land is irrigated Only 4.4% of the land under coffee cultivation is planted with improved varieties, while 2.2 percent is irrigated. C Fruits, vegetables and flowers Ethiopia\u2019s agro-climatic conditions make it suitable for the production of a broad range of fruits and vegetables. Cut flower and vegetable production have been fast-growing export businesses in recent times. Table 2.5 shows that 3.1 million farmers cultivated different kinds of vegetables on about 98.2 thousand hectares of land. Out of this, 0.5, 6.5, 51.1, and 2.9 percent were planted with improved varieties, irrigated treated with organic and inorganic fertilizers, and treated with pesticides, respectively. The average landholding size was about 0.03 ha. Red peppers and Ethiopian cabbage occupy about 56.2 and 24.8 percent of the total area under vegetable crops, respectively.

The major trade partner for Ethiopia\u2019s fruits and vegetables is Djibouti. D Floriculture In recent years, both local and foreign investors are showing a growing interest in the production of cut flowers due to the high demands for fresh cut flowers in European markets, especially in the Netherlands.

Almost all the farming and livestock practices in the highlands of Ethiopia depend on rainfall. The variability of rainfall in time and amount affects the country\u2019s crop production and live-stock rearing; millions of cattle have died of the hazard. For instance, the drought that occurred in 1972/73 victimized 100,000 people and their cattle. This disaster has continued up to now with more than thirty-and forty-fold victims. If the situation is not checked, the number of victims will increase in unimaginable ways. ii Human-Made Problems - These are negative effects that result from the social and economic practices. Land fragmentation: In a country like Ethiopia, where the majority of the people\u2019s livelihood is attached to land, entitlement to land possession, land size, and land utilization are core. In rural Ethiopia, where the average landholding size is shrinking over time, land fragmentation and over-cultivation are inevitable. This decreases the productivity of the farm plots, in turn effecting food insecurity at a national level and causing the migration of rural people into urban environments. Lack of infrastructure: poor infrastructure facilities is a the major problem in the agricultural sector. Transportation and communication facilities are poorly developed in rural Ethiopia. About 75% of rural household farms are located far away from transportation and communication lines, and this that prevents farmers from accessing proper markets and information about prices for their products. Lack of credit facilities: A serious problem that the Ethiopian small-landholders face is the absence of microfinance institutions to provide the farmers with credit facilities to overcome shortages of money for buying improved seeds, fertilizers and storage facilities. For decades, lack of this facility subjected the farms to the mercy of man-made and natural problems. This prevented farmers from using even the meagre resources available at hand. Now, however, reforms have created accesses to micro-finance loans, opening the gate to increasing small holder productively. Lack of effective land-ownership entitlement: Effective land-ownership entitlement is important for long-term, sustainable agricultural development. Without it we have poor work attitudes, the improper use of common resources, and poor output. Erosion and land degradation: Although Ethiopia\u2019s rugged highlands naturally produce erosion and degradation, the magnitude of the process is accelerated by human activities. When the population of the country increased rapidly after the 1950s and 1960s, the need for more farmland greatly increased. These practices have exacerbated the rate of erosion and degradation which in turn, contribute to the recurrence of drought. Without preventative measures; this situation will accelerate in the near future, putting millions of hectares out of use. Traditional practices: These are rural practices that result in misusing work time, unproductive consumption and retaining resources especially livestock resources unscientifically, resulting in very low output per ox, sheep, goat, etc. The use of backward technology. Inadequate rural markets.",

Particularly, the following two major early 20th century events contributed to the introduction of modern manufacturing industries in Ethiopia:\n  The emergence of a strong central government, which resulted in political stability and\n  The construction of the Ethio-Djibouti railway.\nThese events gave way to the establishment and expansion of cities and the settlement of foreigners, mainly from Armenia, Greece, Italy, and India, which in turn increased the demand for imported commodities and hence created the basis for industrial development. The domestic production of manufactured goods was also necessitated by the increasing problems of transporting bulky imported commodities such as wood, clay, printing products, etc.\nBy 1925 there were 25 factories in the major urban centers of Addis Ababa, Dire Dawa, Asmara, and Massawa. Of these factories, private entrepreneurs established 22 factories. About 10 additional manufacturing industries were built from 1928 to 1941, of which two (the Artistic Printing Press and Ambo Mineral Water) were established before the Italian occupation. The Italians established the Dire Dawa cement and textile factories. The rest were set up by Armenian and Greek settlers. A number of manufacturing industries also came into existence between 1941 and 1955, mainly due to strong relations between Ethiopia and the governments of the United States of America and of the United Kingdom.\nHowever, it was after the 1950\u2019s that industrial development gained strong momentum due to the conscious effort exerted by the Ethiopian government. For instance, the government adopted measures like generous tax incentives and high levels of tariff protection, easy access to domestic credit on favorable terms, and it allowed foreigners to take profits out of the country, thereby helping to attract the inflow of foreign capital to the manufacturing sector.\nThe earliest types of industrial activities were largely confined to small-scale establishments producing wood and furniture, leather, edible oil, soap, flour, etc.\nBut after the Second World War, the improved relationships with the governments of the USA and UK and the import-substitution industrial development strategy adopted by the government resulted in the emergence of large-scale industries in the country. These mainly foreign-owned industries started to produce different light consumer goods such as fiber products, ceramics, bottles and glasses.\nThe change of state to the Military government in 1974 significantly altered the ownership and management of the industrial sector. The Military government declared socialism as its principle and nationalized almost all medium- and large-scale enterprises. About 87 foreign-owned private enterprises were put under the government. The private sector was deliberately discouraged and discriminated against, which brought the dominance of the private sector in Ethiopian industry to an end.\nThe Military government followed the preceding regime\u2019s import-substitution industrial development strategy, but did not change the composition of output in the manufacturing sector. It was still dominated by the production of light consumer goods which heavily depended on technology, raw materials, and spare parts.",

That is, industrialization helps developing nations to alleviate their balance-of-payments problems.\nD The Linkage Argument\nIf industrial development is directed to use local raw materials, it can create strong linkages among the different sectors of the domestic economy. This is due to the dynamic nature of the industrial sector which includes positive externalities in consuming agricultural raw materials to produce consumer and producer goods for the entire economy. For instance, the industrial sector can create backward linkages with the agricultural sector for its raw materials instead of depending on imported raw materials. This gives the sector assured sources of supplies. Similarly, the sector can also create linkages with the market in order to assure market for its products. This is what is called forward linkage. In this regard, the development of modern telecommunication services is expected to be of paramount importance.\nE The Saving/Surplus Argument\nProfit margins in the industrial sector are higher than those in agriculture, and this may lead to higher levels of saving.",

The number of persons engaged and employees during this period showed an increase of 6.4 and 5.8 percent, compared to that of 2006/07, respectively. These increases in the number of persons engaged and employees could be attributed to the increase in the number of establishments created in 2007/08 (CSA, 2009).\nWhen we examine the employment capacity of each industrial group in the manufacturing sector, as of 2007/08:\n  The food and beverage group employed 50%,\n  The non-metal, and paper and printing industrial groups contributed 14% and 10.9% of the sector\u2019s employment, respectively.\nThese three industrial groups, together, employed close to 75% of the total workforce in the manufacturing sub-sector for the year 2007/08.\n  The relative importance of the rest of the industrial groups, in terms of employment, varies between 2.1% in wood and furniture manufacturers to 8.8% in textile-product manufacturers. The decline in the share of employment of these sectors is mainly due to increased employment opportunities in other industrial groups such as in non-metal, paper and printing.",

        "chunk_text": "From the previous chapter you remember that more than 90% of the nation\u2019s foreign currency earnings come from the agricultural sector. The poorly developed industrial sector of Ethiopia contributes very little to the foreign currency earnings of the nation.\nAs we can see from Table 3.2, textiles generate 41.5% of the sector\u2019s foreign exchange, which is the largest contribution. Food and beverages, leather and footwear follow as the second and third with 32.9% and 10.8%, respectively. This pattern has remained almost the same in recent years. The only noticeable change is in the wood and furniture and chemical groups. The total value of wood and furniture and chemical exports in 2007/08 was Birr 43,269.7 and 30,198.9, respectively. This can be taken as an indicator of the potential the nation has in bringing in foreign currency from non-traditional commodities. The benefits for the Ethiopian manufacturing sub-sector from preferential treatment which the developed world offers are great. In this regard, The Africa Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA), which allows some developing countries, including Ethiopia, to have access to the US textile market without tariffs and quotas, is the most notable opportunity. European countries are also opening their markets to African manufactured products. For instance, Ethiopia can now sell its sugar products in European markets. Therefore, the nation should try its best to benefit from these and other preferential treatments which the developed world is offering to the poorest nations of Africa.",

        "chunk_text": "A Development Strategies\nThe policies of regimes are one of the major factors influencing the development of the industrial sector of a nation. In Ethiopia, various industrial development strategies have been employed in order to develop and direct this sector since the 1950s.\nIndustrialization in Ethiopia was at an incipient stage during the Imperial period. A conscious effort towards developing a modern industrial sector did not start till the1950s. It was only in the 1950s, when development plans (the three five-year plans) were formulated, that the development of the industrial sector began to be shaped by policies and strategies pertinent to the manufacturing sub-sector. The main agents for the expansion of the industrial sector during this period were foreign nationals residing in Ethiopia. It was believed that the settlement of foreigners and the expansion of commercial farms would continue to give impetus to the growth and expansion of the industrial sector. Hence, development programs and government policies were formulated to pursue this objective. A number of proclamations were declared to encourage foreign investment, and the investment proclamation was revised in 1964.\nA number of incentives such as tax holidays, easy financing loans, exemptions from duty payments, and effective tariff protection from foreign competition were given. However, these incentives were based on some conditions. For example, a tax holiday was for those who had an initial investment of, made more than Birr 200,000 and duty exemption was for heavy machinery.\nDuring the later years of the Imperial era, the main strategy for industrial development was import-substituion, a process assisted by a system of import duties intended to encourage the domestic production of goods and to discourage imported goods. The government placed much faith on private foreign investment and it went to a considerable length to attract it. As a result of the existing polices and the enabling investment environment, a number of manufacturing establishments were created. There was, however, an obvious neglect of small-scale industries during that period as the investment incentives benefited only the medium- and large-scale manufacturing establishments.\nAlthough the trend was mildly encouraging in the last few years of the Imperial government, the actual level of manufacturing activity and its employment creation was very low compared with the case in other developing countries. Although several reasons can be given to explain the poor performance of the industrial sector, poor infrastructure facilities and the level of articulated government economic policy towards the development of the sector were the main constraints. In fact, as we will discuss later on, these problems have also been inherent in other regimes.",

        "chunk_text": "Manufacturing can be classified into different categories by using different criteria. The criteria vary from country to country. For instance, in Japan enterprises that have less than 10 million yen and that employ fewer than 300 employees are considered as small-scale industries. But for Egypt, small-scale industries are those having a fixed capital of at least USD 23,000 and employing not more than 50 employees. Ethiopia also has its own criteria.\nAccording to the Central Statistical Authority (CSA), the Ethiopian manufacturing sector is classified into three, namely large- and medium-scale, small-scale and cottage/handcraft manufacturing. This categorization is mainly based on the number of people employed and use or non-use of power-driven machinery: Large- and medium-scale manufacturing establishments use power-driven machinery and employ 10 persons and above. Small-scale industries are those establishments that employ less than 10 persons and use power-driven machinery. Cottage/handcrafts units are those establishments that produce goods and services primarily for sale but do not use power-driven machinery in performing their main activities, regardless of the number of persons employed.\nAccording to the Ethiopian Economic Association (EEA) report, during the Imperial period, industrialization, with an inward looking orientation based on import substituion, was pursued as a matter of government policy. As a result, a good number of manufacturing enterprises were established, including 80 factories, mostly by private businessmen of foreign origin. Only eight of these eighty establishments were fully government-owned, while another five were joint ventures where the government had over 50% ownership. By 1974, only 26 of the total number of manufacturing enterprises were either fully or partially owned by the government, and in seven of them the government\u2019s stake was less than 50%.The great majority of the manufacturing firms in Ethiopia before the 1974 revolution, especially the medium- and large-scale ones, were owned by foreigners. Out of 273 establishments, 178 or 65% were set up with the assistance of foreigners, and 101 or 40% were totally owned by foreign nationals. In short, by 1974 the industrial sector of Ethiopia was small and characterized by production for the domestic market, mainly to substitute for imports, and its enterprises were largely private and foreign owned. The role of the government in the evolution of the Ethiopian manufacturing industries prior to 1974, at least as direct producers, was very limited.",

        "chunk_text": "Development Strategies\nThe industrial sector underwent a radical change in the structure of ownership and management during this period. As a first step in this process, the government nationalized almost all the medium- and large-scale enterprises which were formerly owned by the private sector on December, 20, 1975. It also imposed a capital ceiling on private sector investment, limited to Birr 500,000, and investors were not allowed to have licenses for more than one line of business. This discouraged any possible revival of the private sector in medium-, large-scale and handcraft activities. The tax structure was also very harsh, with the maximum rate on personal income going as high as 89%. The interest rate was also higher for private borrowers, relative to that for public enterprises and cooperatives. These polices severely hampered the expansion of the manufacturing sector during the Military government by paralyzing the private sector.\nLater on, the Ten-Year Perspective Plan (1984/85 \u2013 1993/94) sought to promote the production of intermediate and capital goods and the expansion of small-scale industries. The state took responsibility for developing and managing the medium- and large-scale industries with wide linkages to capital-good producing industries that could be used to develop other manufacturing industries. The prevailing economic management policy created different hierarchies in the industrial sector. Putting the Ministry of Industry at the top, corporations were established to supervise the management of the grouped enterprises. The general managers had the responsibility of supervising the day-to-day operations of the industrial enterprises in accordance with the guidelines prepared by the Ministry. The plan, however, failed to attain its goals for various reasons, and significant improvements were not witnessed in the structure and the level of development of the sub-sector. For example, government corporations decided whether these enterprises were efficient. Accordingly, producing enterprises had weak links with market forces, which did not permit them to have the necessary feedback so as to become more competitive in the market. In short, the industrial policy of the Derg stifled the speedy development of the sector by creating too much government intervention and by limiting the participation of the private sector.\nTo support small-scale industrial enterprises, the government established the Handicrafts and Small-Scale Industrial Development Agency (HASIDA) in 1975. But this did not help much in achieving the required pace of growth in the small-scale industrial sector. This might have been due to the lack of institutional and other supportive measures that should have been taken to boost the capacity and the efficiency of the small-scale and handicrafts enterprises.\nAfter the collapse of socialism in Eastern Europe and, later, in the former Soviet Union, the regime tried to introduce some economic liberalization by way of introducing a mixed economic policy. A number of constraints that stood in the way of private-sector development were lifted. For instance, the capital-ceiling restriction was relaxed. However, several of these encouraging measures did not attain their goals because as the civil war reached its climax and diverted government resources towards resolving security problems.",

It is only for the 10+ group (manufacturing establishments with 10 or more employees) that time series data was available. According to this survey, the number of manufacturing establishments with 10 or more employees in 1975/76 was 430. This number declined to 402 in 1985/86, a decline of 0.82% per annum. It further declined to 273 in 1992/93, the lowest ever registered, eventually growing to 642 by the time of the survey in 1995/96.\nThere are several reasons that explain this decline.\n  The first is the decrease in the number of employees, owing to low capacity utilization which in turn was caused by the unfavorable government policies towards private activities to obtain foreign exchange (for raw materials, spare parts and replacements), credit and licences. Therefore, some of the establishments fell below the \u201c10 and above\u201d employee category. The way the number of establishments fluctuated year after year seems to prove this.\n  The possibility was high for establishments to cease operation for the obvious reasons of the period, such as war, burdensome regulations, and lack of foreign exchange. Indeed, the economic policy of the time did not encourage the establishment of firms.\n  The third reason the independence of Eritrea, achieved by 1991/92, which reduced the number of industries by the number of those that existed in Eritrea.\nA few surveys have been conducted on handicrafts and small-scale industries. These include the survey undertaken by HASIDA in 1989 and 1991 on private small-scale manufacturing establishments and the one conducted by CSA in 1997 on handicrafts/cottage and small-scale industries.",

        "chunk_text": "Development Strategies\nAfter the over-throw of the socialist government and its replacement by the\nEthiopian Peoples Revolutionary Democratic Front (EPRDF) in 1991, the\ngovernment sought to rationalize its role in the economy while enhancing the\nactive participation of the private sector.\nAccordingly, the transitional government of Ethiopia announced an economic\npolicy which could be described as \u201ccautious captialism\u2019\u2019. Believed to be\nconducive for investment, the government accepted the Structural Adjustment\nPrograms (SAPs), though with some reservations.\nWith respect to the industrial sector, the Transitional Government of Ethiopia\n(TGE) indicated that the role of the state would be limited to areas of large-scale\nengineering, metallurgical plants, communications, power, and pharmaceutical\nindustries from which the private sector was bared. The government, undertook\na Public-Enterprises Reform Program in August 1992, which aimed at enhancing\nefficiency, productivity, and competitiveness in public enterprises (most of\nwhich were manufacturing) through the granting of managerial autonomy and\nresponsibility. This was done by dismantling the sub-sectoral corporations\nunder the Ministry of Industry. The overall management of each manufacturing\nenterprise was thus put under its own board of directors and a general manager\nresponsible for output, price, and investment decisions as well as appropriate\nmarket channels.\nIn general, these measures were designed with the long-term objective of raising\nthe share of the industrial sector in the economy, both in terms of output and\nemployment creation and of enhancing the development of strategic industries\nwhich were expected to have multiplier effects through contributing to the\nexpansion and development of other economic activities. Laws were enacted\nto give enterprises management autonomy, a more flexible labor code was\nproclaimed, prices were largely decontrolled, foreign trade and financial\ninstitutions, including the foreign exchange market, were particularly taken to\nencourage private sector participation in the economy. These include:\n  the lifting of the restrictions on private-sector investment capital and\nthe number of business ventures;\n  the easing of licensing requirements and regulations;\n  the enactment of an investment code which, upon successive revisions,\nopened up a wider range of economic activities for both domestic\nand foreign investors. In addition to the investment code, investment\nincentives were offered in the form of tax holidays, duty-free importation\nof investment goods and the like designed to favour investment in\nselected sectors and regions; and\n  the downward revision of taxes and tariffs from the extremely high\nlevels that existed before the reform period. The marginal tax rate on\npersonal income was also slashed from 89% to 40%. Business profit tax\nwas reduced from 59% to 35%, while the maximum tariff on imports\nwas reduced to 50% down from 240%.\nIn addition to the above measures, the government introduced an overall\ndevelopment strategy, the Agricultural Development-Led Industrialization\n(ADLI) strategy. As stated in Chapter two, agriculture is the primary focus of\ndevelopment in the short and medium terms, and its production will be expanded\nthrough increased availability of modern inputs such as fertilizers, improved\nseeds, and pesticides and through improved extension services and other socio-\neconomic infrastructures. This, of course, is expected to increase the income\nof rural people, which will, in turn, raise the purchasing power of the largest\nproportion of the population, consequently augmenting the demand for industrial\ngoods. Agriculture would become a source of domestic market demand and a\nreliable raw material base. This strategy is also expected to strengthen the inter-\nsectoral linkage between agriculture and industry.\nTo sum up, several interventions have been made to enhance the development\nof this sector. Key among these measures is the establishment and strengthening\nof institutions necessary to promote industrialization. A policy goal is to create\na conducive environment for industrial development by developing infrastructure\nand the nation\u2019s technological capability. Other goals are to promote inter- and intra-\nsectoral linkages, create an appropriate financial environment, encourage balanced\nregional industrial development and strengthen the linkage between industry and\nother sectors. Also, in addition to expanding the domestic market for industrial\nproducts by increasing the income of the rural population as a result of the ADLI\nstrategy, the government policy is also designed to promote industrial exports.",

The majority of the establishments do not use power-\ndriven machinery, irrespective of the number of persons employed.\nThe sectoral structure of the manufacturing sub-sector, 2007/08 based on numbers\nof establishments, reveals that food and beverage establishments accounted for\n52% of the total manufacturing enterprises, while textiles accounted for 22%, as\nindicated in Table 3.4.\nAs shown in Table 3.4, food and beverage, textile and non-metallic minerals\ndominate the Ethiopian manufacturing sub-sector. These groups accounted for\n83% of the total number of establishments during 2007/08. The concentration\nof Ethiopian manufacturing activities in these establishments might be due to\nthe fact that they depend heavily on local inputs and due to the availability of\ndomestic markets for their products.\nThe number of large- and medium-scale establishments reached 779 in 1998/99\nfrom its level of 642 in 1995/96, with an annual average growth rate of 6.8%. This\ngrowth rate is not satisfactory, given the low level of manufacturing activities in\nthe nation.\nWhen we come to the ownership structure, small-scale and cottage/handcrafts\nenterprises are totally owned and managed by the private sector. The ownership\nof large- and medium-scale manufacturing enterprises has shown changes in the\npast few decades. During the Imperial period, this sub-sector was dominated\nby the public sector, due to various measures taken by the governments. The\nproportion of public-to-private establishments showed continuous increase during\nthe period of the Derg, reaching a maximum of around 120% in 1991/92, with\n152 out of 279 enterprises owned by the government. However, this trend has\nbeen reversed due to the economic policies adopted by the EPRDF government.\nAs you can see from Table 3.5, the share of the private sector increased from\n46.3% in 1995/96 to 91.5% in 2007/08. This is due to the active involvement of the\nprivate sector, the privatization program, and the withdrawal of the government\nfrom new investments in the area of large- and medium-scale manufacturing.\nHowever this does not mean that the private sector has the largest share in terms\nof output. Even though the value of output of the private sector, using both\nGross Value of Product (GVP) and Value Added at Factor Cost (VAFC), showed\nincrements from 1995/96 to 2007/08, it is very recently that the public sector\ndominance in large- and medium-scale manufacturing in terms of output has been\novertaken by the private sector. This is one underlying reason that the private\nsector employed 66.3% of the total labour force engaged in this sub-sector.\nWhen we look at the regional distribution of the manufacturing establishments,\nwe see unbalanced distribution. In general, it is better to have evenly distributed\nmanufacturing establishments, but distribution depends on several factors\nincluding infrastructural developments, including those in roads, electricity,\ncommunication, water, proximity to input and output markets and social services.\nFrom Table 3.6, we can see that Addis Ababa has the largest number of\nestablishments land provides the most employment in the sector: 46.4%,\nand 48.4%, respectively. Oromia follows Addis Ababa with 16.7% of the\nestablishments and 24.0% of total employment in the sector. Tigray and Amhara\ntake the 3rd and 4th place in regional distribution of the establishments. The 3rd\nplace in value added and employment shares are taken by Tigray. In Table 3.6,\nthe category \u201cOthers\u201d includes the four relatively less developed regions, namely\nSomali, Afar, Benishangul-Gumz and Gambella, which, together, have only\n1.5% of the establishments. These values indicate the unbalanced manufacturing\nestablishment distribution. In an attempt to narrow this gap, the existing\ninvestment code of the country promises special incentives for investors who\nwant to work in those backward regions.",

This share declined\nto 12.2% and 10.9% in the periods spanning from 1980 - 1990 and 1991 - 1999,\nrespectively. This implies that even if the broader definition of industry is taken\n(including mining and quarrying, manufacturing, electricity and water, and\nconstruction), the contribution of this sector to the national economy is not only\nmarginal but declined over time. According to the information obtained from the\nnational Bank of Ethiopia (NBE, 2008/09) the industry share of GDP for 1999/00 \u2013\n2008/09 was 13.1%. If we look at the GDP role of each component of the industrial\nsector in the national economy, we find that large- and medium-scale manufacturing\naccounted for 4.3%, small-scale 2.01 percent, and handcrafts 2.58 percent of\nthe national output in the period spanning 1991-1999. The major contribution\ncame from the large- and medium-scale manufacturing sector, as indicated in\nTable 3.7.\nExample 1: Let the gross value of output of the small - scale industry during the\nyear 2003 be 913, 921, 346. If the value of intermediate input or cost of raw\nmaterial used to produce the above state output is 3 million, what will be\nthe value added at factor cost?\nVAFC = 913,921,346 \u2013 3,000,000 = 910,921,346\nExample 2: The total industrial employment during the year 2007/08 (CSA)\nis 1,677,906.

The share\nof small-scale and handcrafts showed marginal increments during the last two\ndecades of that period and then declined there after. \u2018Other\u2019 sub-sectors which,\ntogether, contributed about 20.3% and 58.6% to the total industrial GDP during\nthe periods of 1991-1999 and 2000 -2008, respectively, include mining and\nquarrying, water, and electricity.\nThe size of 1995/96 manufacturing output shown in Table 3.8 indicates that a\nsignificant proportion of the gross value of output came from a small number\nof large- and medium-scale manufacturing activities, followed by cottage and\nhandcrafts.\nThe bulk of output, which is about 72.2%, is created by large- and medium-\nscale manufacturing, and the contribution of small-scale industry is insignificant.\nIn terms of value added at factor cost, large- and medium-scale manufacturing\nestablishments contributed a significant proportion of the total value added,\nfollowed by cottage/handicrafts. This suggests that we should have a closer look\nat the performance of large- and medium-scale manufacturing establishments.\nThe following analysis will be limited to large- and medum-scale manufacturing\nestablishments because of the availability of adequate information on these\nestablishments and because of their greater contribution to the national economy.\nThe Ethiopian large and medium-scale manufacturing sub-sector is characterized\nby the dominance of four-consumer good producing industrial groups, namely\nthe food and beverages, textiles, and leather and shoes groups. These groups of\nindustries account for the bulk of the gross value of output and for the value added\nof the sub-sector. For instance, the four groups of industries (but substituting\nchemical for leather and shoes) accounted for 78% of the gross value of output\nduring the 1980s. However, the gross value of the output of the large- and medium-\nscale manufacturing sub-sector declined by about 1.6 percent during the1980s\ndue to a sharp decline in the production of the chemical and textile groups.\nThe decline or stagnation in the gross value of output of the large- and medium-\nscale manufacturing sub-sector reversed after the launching of the economic\nreform program. The available official documents indicate that almost all\nlarge- and medium-scale manufacturing industrial groups showed significant\nimprovement after the reform program was implemented. The gross value of\noutput of the large- and medium-scale manufacturing sector registered an average\nannual growth rate of 20.2 % during the period covering 1991/92 - 1998/99 as\nshown in Table 3.9.\nIn absolute terms production increased from Birr 1.8 billion in 1991/1992 to\nBirr 7.3 billion in 1998/99. That is, production quadrupled, representing an\nannual average growth rate of 20.5%. The major share of the increment in the\nvalue of production was contributed by food, chemical, non-metal and metal,\nwhich achieved average annual growth rates of 22.9%, 26.9%, 30.2%, and\n35%, respectively, during the period of 1991/92 - 1998/99. The smallest annual\naverage growth during the reform period in gross value of output was observed in\nthe tobacco industrial group. It registered an annual average growth rate of 7.8%\nduring the period under consideration.\nNote that a mere increase in the gross value of the output of manufacturing\nindustries might not have meaningful economic importance unless it is supported\nby a commensurate growth in the value added. Evidence indicates that the value\nadded in the large- and medium-scale manufacturing declined annually at an\naverage rate of 2.4% during the 1980s. However, this trend has been reversed\nsince the introduction of the economic reform program. The value added at factor\ncost of large- and medium-scale manufacturing increased from Birr 336.8 million\nin 1991/92 to Birr 1,982.9 million in 1998/99, representing an annual average\ngrowth rate of 25.3% during the period covering 1991/92 - 1998/99.\nFood, non-metal, leather and shoes, and chemicals registered high annual growth\nrate of 34%, 33.2%, 27.6% and 25%, respectively, in value added in the period\nspanning 1991/92 - 1998/99. The lowest annual growth in value added during\nthat period was recorded in the wood and furniture group Also, the beverage\nand textile groups increased by 1.9% to 11.9% annually during the same period,\nrespectively.\nAnother indicator of the performance of the manufacturing sector is the value\nadded per person, defined as the ratio of value added created to the number of\npersons employed. Value added per person is also known as labor productivity.\nValue added per person declined at an annual average rate of 3.4% during the\n1980s. This might have been be due to, among other things, redundancy of labor\nin the sector together with obsolete and outdated technology causing the marginal\nproduct of labour to decline over time. After the reform, however, value added\nper person increased. Labor productivity was highest in metal, followed by those\nof food and leather and shoes. Labor productivity registered an annual average\ngrowth rate of 33.9%, 30.1%, and 25.6% in the metal, food, and leather and shoe\nindustrial groups, respectively, during the 1991/92 - 1998/99 period.\nThe manufacturing sector has shown improvements in terms of gross value of\noutput, value added, and value added per person during the post-reform period.\nThis might be attributed to the incentive for profit and the creation of a relatively\nconducive environment induced by the granting of managerial autonomy to\npublic enterprises; the active involvement of a number of private manufacturing\nestablishments; the improved availability of inputs and spare parts; and the\nrecovery of the agricultural sector, which enhanced the supply of raw materials\nto the manufacturing sector. These factors are expected to continue to contribute\nto the improvements in the performance of the manufacturing sector.",

Let us examine some of\nthese problems.\nA Lack of Finance\nThe shortage of financial resources has been one for the major bottlenecks for\nindustrial development in Ethiopia. The possible sources of this finance have been\nagricultural- and non-agricultural-commodity producing sectors in the economy.\nThe agricultural sector, which is the mainstay of the Ethiopian population, has\nnot been capable of generating the required surplus for the industrial sector,\ngiven its subsistence nature and backwardness. The other commodity-producing\nsectors, especially the manufacturing industry, is underdeveloped and most\npublic enterprises are heavy users of foreign exchange. That is, they are highly\nimport-dependent. This means that they have not been net savers and hence have\nno surplus. Given such a low saving rate, it is difficult to undertake industrial\ninvestment.\nHigh collateral requirements by the formal lending institutions have aggravated\nthe problem of financial shortage.\nB Market-Related Problems (Marketing Problems)\nThe availability of markets is obviously one of the determinants of the development\nof the manufacturing sector. According to CSA survey (2000), market-related\nproblems accounted for 39.5% of the underutilization of the capacity observed in\nthe large- and medium-scale manufacturing establishments.\nMarket-related problems arise due to the following factors:\n  Weak domestic demand for manufacturing output \u2014 this is due to the\nsubsistence nature of agriculture on which the vast majority of the\npeople rely for food, etc. As a result, the purchasing power of the people\nis very low.\n  Lack of marketing information about both local and export markets.\n  Strong competition from cheap imports.\n  A consumer bias against local products.\nC Technology-Related Problems (Technological Problems)\nIt is argued that it is impossible to think of industrial development without the\napplication of modern science and technology. Technology-related problems\nhave contributed to the poor level of industrialization in Ethiopia.\nTechnological problems may reveal themselves in one of the following ways:\n  Lack of sufficient information on appropriate technology. This is a\nserious obstacle to both existing firms and to those investors wishing to\ninvest in the sector. This is related to the shortage of local institutions\ninvolved in technological support services.\n  The technology we have today is not developed based on available\nlocal raw materials. This limits the linkage that is expected in the\ndomestic economy of the manufacturing sector. It rather makes the\nsector triangulating the shortage of foreign currency of the country.\nThe ratio of imported raw material to total raw material is too high for\nEthiopian local manufacturing to flourish. For instance, in 2002/03,\nthe import intensity was 22.0% and 29.0% for food and beverage, and\ntextile groups, respectively. The situation is worse in basic iron and\nsteel, and motor vehicles, trailers, and semi-trailers, with 99.2% and\n93.4%, respectively. On average, for the indicated year, the import\nintensity for all medium- and large-scale manufacturing was 43.5%.\n  The technology we use is also capital intensive. This approach\nis basically not recommended for economies like Ethiopia where\nunemployment is rising.\nD Input-Related Problems\nInput-related problems also hamper the development of industry in Ethiopia.\nThis is mainly due to the high cost and shortage of foreign exchange for imported\ninputs and to the unreliability of domestic sources of inputs and their poor quality.\nThe survey conducted by CSA in 2000 ranked the shortage of raw materials as\nthe second most serious problem that contributes to the underutilization observed\nin large- and medium-scale enterprises, accounting for 25.9% of the total\nunderutilization.\nThere are also other problems like policy problems and human-resource-related\nproblems in relation to lack of skilled manpower and absence of industrial\ndiscipline and work ethics. These and other problems do not only limit new\ninvestments, but also reduce the productive capacity of the already existing\nenterprises. For instance, according to CSA (2000), the large- and medium-\nscale manufacturing establishments used only 49.2% of their capacity due to\nvarious problems, the most serious of which were market-related problems\nand the shortage of raw materials. Therefore, in order to create accelerated\nindustrialization in Ethiopia, it is imperative to identify and tackle the problems\nthat are hampering the development of this sector.",

        "chunk_text": "During 2003/04 - 2007/08, the Ethiopian economy witnessed broad-based and sustainable growth, owing to large-scale efforts undertaken by the government in the areas of infrastructure, agriculture, rural development and poverty alleviation programs and investments, and also owing to favorable weather conditions that characterized those years. In line with this, an average real GDP growth rate of 11.9 percent was registered during the 2003/04-2007/08 period. For 2003/07, the real GDPs for the agriculture, service, and industrial sectors were 7.5%, 16.0%, and 10.1%, respectively.\nThe service sector or the service industry is one of the three main economic sectors. The basic characteristic of this sector is the production of services (also known as \u2018intangible goods\u2019), and does not include the goods-producing sector.\nThis sector is composed of various sub-sectors. More specifically, the service sector includes: trade, hotels and restaurants, transport and communication, education, banking and insurance, public administration and defense, health, and other services.\nAccording to the Ethiopian National Income Account classification, the first five sub-sectors are referred to as distributive services while the remaining are in the \u2018Other\u2019 service sector.\nAccording to the 2009/10, MOFED Report the GDP share of the service sector increased from 41.1% in 2002/03 to 46% in 2009/10. This is mainly the result of the fast growth in the areas of real estate, hotel and restaurant, education, and health. In contrast, the share of agriculture fell from its level of 56.7% in 1995/06 to 42% in 2009/10.\nThere are a number of ways to consider the service sector such as:\n  Its divisions,\n  Its components, and\n  The types of activities within the components.\nThe service division includes a wide variety of industries, but they can be categorized into primarily consumer-oriented (providing a service directly to a consumer), primarily business-oriented (providing a service directly to another business) or mixed (providing services to both businesses and individual consumers).\nAlternately, the activities of the services division can be described in reference to their economic activities as:\n  physical,   intellectual,   aesthetic\ni Physical activities: involve working with objects; examples include repairing cars, hairdressing, and cooking.\nii Intellectual activities: involve providing education or training at such levels as university and vocational school.\niii The aesthetic activities: entail providing consumers with artistic experiences such as offered by museums, theater performances, art shows, and musical performances.",

        "chunk_text": "What do you think about the role of the service sector?\nDiscuss the significance of the service sector to the Ethiopia economy.\nThe service sector plays an important role in the country\u2019s economy. Its contribution can be seen from three angles, namely: output, employment, and foreign exchange contributions.\nA Output contribution\nThe service sector has played a dominant role, next to the agriculture sector, in the Ethiopian economy. But in 2008/09 and 2009/10, the output contribution of the service sector in Ethiopia dominated the agriculture sector, contributing about 45% and 46% respectively.\nThis mainly the result of the fast growth of education, health, socio services, tourism, transport service, construction and related engineering services, wholesaler and retail trade, hotel and restaurant sub sectors. Moreover, relatively large investment expended on the sector.\nB Employment contribution\nIn Ethiopia, the service sector is the second largest sector, next to agriculture, in terms of absorbing a significant part of the labor force. About 1.4% of the total labor force is employed in the health and education sectors, while about 0.5% is employed in the communication and transport sectors.\nIn Ethiopia, a significant number of mostly permanent employment opportunities are being created because of the rapidly growing economy. In particular, employment opportunities are being created by:\n  Sustained government efforts to enhance private sector investments;\n  The big push in infrastructure development;\n  The expanding services industry; and\n  The rapid growing horticulture sector\nC Foreign exchange contribution\nThe value of exports of services increased from $261 million in 1980 to $348 million in 1998, representing an average growth rate of 33%.\nIn 2008/09, foreign exchange income earned from service providers such as Ethiopian Airlines and Ethiopian Shipping Lines, as well as from various service sub-sectors such as tourism, communication, insurance and financial services, collectively reached nearly 2 billion dollars, when compared to just 1.5 billion dollars for the export of goods.",

Education in Ethiopia dates back to the 4th Century. For about 1,500 years, the church controlled most of the traditional educational institutions. However, education in Ethiopia has undergone tremendous changes since the 19th century as a result of government policies that have attempted to improve basic education.\nFormal education began in 1908. However, the education system in Ethiopia suffered from shortcomings in quality, coverage, efficiency, and relevance, due to the following four key problems.\nFirst, the education and training policies that were in place for many decades focused only on solving immediate problems, rather than tackling major long-term challenges at the national level.\nSecond, children \u2013 especially girls \u2013 were not encouraged to attend school.\nThird, since there were no specific learning profiles set for students at different levels, neither the student nor the teacher had a clear vision of what and why they were learning or teaching.\nFourth, too many subjects were taught, both at primary and secondary levels (up to 15 in some cases), which resulted in lessons being too fragmented to develop necessary skills, attitudes, and behaviors.\nBecause of these and other constraints, the educational system was unable to contribute to solving the development problems of the country.\nThe same hypothesis holds true for institutions of higher education. Higher education started 50 years ago and was entrusted with the task of producing capable, problem-solving, responsible citizens. Nevertheless, the reality prevailing in higher institutions was far from encouraging. This was especially true during the Imperial Regime.\nDue to the inappropriate education policy of the Military Regime, the coverage of education was, relatively, very narrow. And a number of schools were demolished by the war in different parts of the country. One of the characteristics of the Derg was its spending on defence rather than expanding the sector. Between 1987 and 1991, only 8.94% of the annual budget was allocated for education.\nBut the allocation for education between 2003/04 and 2007/08 was 22.6% (according to Education Statistics Annual Abstract, 2007-2008 pp-15). According to Education Statistics Annual Abstract 2007/08, school construction at different levels in different regions of a country increased rapidly post-1990.\nThe population of school-age, both male and female, increased from 69,126,001 to 73,819,951 between 2003/04 and 2007/08 (Education Statistics Annual Abstract, 2007-2008 pp-10).",

        "chunk_text": "i Pre-1974: Generally speaking in this era the government didn\u2019t adopt strategies for the education sector. But in 1925, the government issued a plan to expand secular education. Ten years later there were only 8,000 students enrolled in 20 public schools. A few students also studied abroad on government scholarships. Schools closed during the Italian occupation of January 1936 - 1941. After the restoration of Ethiopian independence, schools reopened, but the system had shortages of teachers, textbooks and facilities. The government recruited foreign teachers for primary and secondary schools to off-set the teacher shortage.\nThe Imperial government initiated a comprehensive study of the education system. The education sector review (ESR) recommended attaining universal primary education, ruralizing the curricula through the inclusion of informal training, equalizing educational opportunities, and relating the entire system to the national development process. However, the ESR was not published until February 1974.\nBy contrast, the Derg invested relatively highly in education, in particular through the expansion of schools in rural areas and by launching an adult education program called the Literacy Campaign. These efforts had reduced the illiteracy rate to 38% by 1990. Although the drive for expanding primary education continued in the post-Derg period, the Literacy Campaign was stopped, and this explains the recent rise in the level of illiteracy.\nGiven these trends, it is not surprising to see that the positive contribution of education per worker in the period 1989-90 produced, relatively speaking, the period in which the literacy rate was highest.\nii Post-1974: the Military Government dismantled the feudal socioeconomic structure through a series of reforms that also affected the educational sector. By the early 1975, the government closed Haile Selassie I University and all senior secondary schools and had deployed some 60,000 students and teachers to rural areas to participate in the government\u2019s Development through Cooperation Campaign (commonly referred to as zemecha). In 1975, the Derg Regime nationalized all private schools.\nEducation for socialist consciousness, education for production and education for science and research\u2019 became the objectives and directives set during the Military Government. The Military Government also worked towards a more even distribution of schools by concentrating its efforts on small towns and rural areas that had been neglected during the Imperial Regime.\nPrimary education enrollment increased over the years 1968 to 2003:\niii Post-1991: The gross enrollment ratios for primary and secondary education have since showed an upward trend: 68.4% in 2003/04 for primary education and 22.1% for secondary education. The government of Ethiopia is now working towards achieving universal primary education by the year 2015 (MEDaC, 1999, MoE, 2005).\nThe Ethiopian government in 1993/94 introduced a National Education and Training Policy strategy to gradually overcome the aforementioned problems of quality, quantity, and efficiency. An education system is said to be efficient if maximum output is obtained from a given input, or if a given output is obtained with minimum possible input. In a more complete definition of output, the educational attainment of the pupils, the dropout rate, and the level of educational achievement of the graduates should be taken into account.\nEducational inputs comprise the buildings, teachers, books, teaching materials, etc., which may be aggregated financially in terms of expenditures per pupil-year.\nIn order to improve the critical situation of the education sector, the government launched the Education Sector Development Program (ESDP) in 1997.\nThe ESDP outlines long-term goals for the sector and the means to attain them by way of a series of phased, medium-term plans. The program has the following six components:\n  Primary Education: Activities under this component include: construction, expansion, and rehabilitation of primary schools; curriculum revision and development; upgrading of teachers\u2019 skills; and increasing the supply of textbooks.\n  Secondary Education: Activities under this component include: expansion of school services; curriculum revision and development; and increases in the supply of educational equipment and material.\n  Technical-Vocational Training: Under this component, there are plans to expand programs that train students in technical and vocational fields.\n  Teacher Training: This component includes: the upgrading and expansion of training institutions; in-service (on-the-job) training of primary school teachers; curriculum revision and development; introduction of distance learning and alternative education methods; and the training of school directors or coordinators in school management.",

The most significant progress is the Gross Enrolement Rate (GER) in primary schools. As a result of the expansion of schools in rural areas, and of improvements in awareness of the need for the education of girls at the community level, primary education, particularly the first cycle (1-4), enrollment has increased significantly. GER (1-8) was 22 percent for boys and 16 percent for girls in 1991, and was it is 98 percent for males and 85.1 percent for females in 2006/2007. However, there are wide regional variations in female enrollement rates. Some of the lowest rates for girls are in emerging regions and pastoralist areas. The national gender gap at the primary level was 20.2 percent in 1999/2000 and 12.9 percent in 2006/07. Despite such improvements, this gap is still a cause for concern.\nSecondary Education (Grade 9 \u2013 12)\nObjectives of Secondary Education\nThe major objectives of secondary education are enabling students to identify area of interest for further education and vocational training (9 \u2013 10) and preparing them for higher education (11 \u2013 12)\n  To provide basic education and integrated knowledge at various levels of vocational training.\n  To satisfy the country\u2019s need for skilled manpower by providing training in various skills and at different levels.\nSecondary school in Ethiopia provides post-primary education in two cycles. The first is Grades 9-10 and the second is Grades 11 \u2013 12. Secondary education expansion and construction has focus predominantly on the first cycle.\nSecondary Gross Enrollment Rate (GER)\nSecondary-school GERs compare those students, regardless of age, with the population of the appropriate age range. For Ethiopia, the ages for the first cycle (general secondary) is 15 \u2013 16, and that for the second cycle is 17 \u2013 18 years of age.\nTable 4.7 shows the secondary school-age enrollment composition, by cycle, gender and Gross Enrolement Rate for each year of 2003/04-2007/08.\nAs can be seen from Table 4.7, enrolement grew, but in the first cycle, the rates for boys and girls diverged, with boys predominating.\nChallenges related to girls\u2019 education becomes greater as one moves up to secondary level and above. The gap increased from 6.7 percent in 2001/2002 to 14.8 percent during 2007/08 for the secondary school first cycle. This change is mainly attributable to the high dropout rates of girls from Grade eight on. Several factors explain this situation. A few of them are:\n  Girls reach the age of puberty between the ages of 14-16 and in most rural areas get married through family arrangement or by abduction;\n  High schools might not be available close to a girl\u2019s neighborhood. Therefore, girls may need to walk far, to reach them but their families might fear for their safety, including dangers of rape;\n  Furthermore, in cases where girls would need to reside in a different town in order to receive such education, their families might not be able to pay for housing, food, and related expenses.\nHigher Education\nHigher education in Ethiopia includes institutions with three, four, and six-year undergraduate programs, as well as two-year master programs and three-year Ph.D. programs.\nTable 4.8 shows that total enrollment in the higher education institutions in 2007-08, for 61 reporting government and non-government institutions, was 270,356 in all programs, including:\n  Regular   Evening   Kiremt and distance.\nAs noted in Table 4.8, out of this, non-government institutions enroll approximately 48,802 students, which accounts for 18.1% of the total. Data for non-government institutions captures only those institutions that are accredited by the Ministry of Education (MoE). Additionally, over 97.2% of all enrollments are at the undergraduate-degree level.\nPupil-Teacher Ratio (PTR)\nPupil-teacher ratio is one of the common indicators for efficiency and quality in education. However, there are two conflicting views about PTR:\n  The lower the PTR is, the better the opportunity for contact between the teacher and pupils and for the teacher to provide support to students individually, thereby improving the quality of education;\n  On the other hand, a very low PTR may indicate inefficient use or underutilization of teachers, resulting in low efficiency.\nIn Ethiopia, the standard set for the pupil-teacher ratio is 50 pupils per teacher for the primary level (1-8) and is 40 pupils per teacher for the secondary level.",

However, efforts were made to include the health sector into the development plans. After the 1974 revolution, Ethiopia embarked upon different approaches towards solving health-sector problems, through the declaration of primary health care in a ten-year development plan in 1978. In these approaches, priority was given to creative types of strategies. It was highly centralized and there was little collaboration between public and private providers.\nThe Ethiopian Transitional and Federal Government formulated the 1993 Health Policy and Strategy. Goals of the Federal Government and the regional administrations included reorganizing health services to make them more cost-effective and efficient so, that they can contribute more to the overall socio-economic development effort of the country.\nFollowing the change of government in 1991, a number of political and socio-economic reform measures were put in place. Two of these were the development and introduction of a new National Health Policy in 1993 and the formulation of a comprehensive rolling 20-year Health Sector Development Plan (HSDP) in 1997. Both are the results of the critical assessment and analysis of the nature and causes of the country\u2019s health problems. The HSDP is now in its third phase (HSDP III). The major goals of the health policy are decentralization of the health\ncare system, development of preventive, facilitative, and curative components of health care, assurance of accessibility of health care for all segments of the population, and the promotion of private-sector and NGO participation in the health sector.\nThe national health policy focuses on a comprehensive health service delivery system to address:\n  Communicable diseases   Improving maternal and child\n  Malnutrition health.\nThe health service delivery system is decentralized with the responsibility for implementation being largely devolved to the districts, which operate on the basis of block funding for the sector.\nThe policy emphasizes inter-sectoral collaboration, particularly in ensuring family planning for efficient family health and population planning, in formulating and implementing an appropriate food and nutritional policy, and in accelerating the provision of safe and adequate water for the urban and rural populations.\nGeneral Policy goals\nThe main policy goals of (the Health Sector Strategic Plan, HSDP-III, 2005/06-2009/10) are:\n1 Democratization and decentralization of the health service system.\n2 Development of the preventive and facilitative components of health care.\n3 Development of an equitable and acceptable standard for the health service system that will enable it to reach all segments of the population within the limits of resources.\n4 Promoting and strengthening inter-sectoral activities.\n5 Promotion of attitudes and practices conducive to the strengthening of national self-reliance in health development by mobilizing and maximally utilizing internal and external resources.\n6 Assurance of accessibility of health care for all segments of the population.\n7 Working closely with neighboring countries and with regional and international organizations to share information and strengthen collaboration in all activities the contribute to health development, including the control of factors detrimental to health.\n8 Development of appropriate capacity building, based on assessed needs.\n9 Provision of health care for the population on a scheme of payment according to ability, with special assistance mechanisms for those who cannot afford to pay.",

The MMR is used as a measure of the quality\nof a health care system.\n3 Life Expectancy at Birth (LEB): is the probable number of years a\nperson will live after a given age, as determined by mortality in a specific\ngeographic area.\n4 Child mortality rate (CMR): is the number of children dying between the\nfirst and the fifth birthday per 1000 live births.\n5 Access to safe water: is measured by the number of people who have a\nreasonable means of getting an adequate amount of water that is safe for\ndrinking, washing, and essential household activities. It reflects the health\nof a country\u2019s people and the country\u2019s capacity to collect, clean, and\ndistribute water to consumers.\nPerformance\nAccording to the Ministry of Health, the maternal mortality rate in\nEthiopia was reduced to 673/100,000 in 2005/06 from 871/100,000 in\n2001/02.\nThe infant mortality rate was reduced to 77/1000 live births in 2004/05\nfrom 97/1000 in 2001/02 and to 123 /1000 in 1992/93.\nThe child Mortality Rate per 1000 was reduced to 123/1000 in 2004/05\nfrom 167/1000 in 2001/02 and to 180/1000 in 1992/93.\nLife expectancy at birth (measured in years) for each year of the\n2005 \u2013 2010 was, according to a UNICEF report, was 48.83, 49.03,\n49.23, 54.99, 55.41, and 55.8 in that order.\nThe provision of safe and adequate water supplies for the population has far\n-reaching effects on:\nHealth;\nProductivity;\nQuality of life, in particular for reducing poverty; and\nSustainable socio-economic development.\nHence, the Ethiopian government, NGOs, the community, and the private sector\nhave undertaken maximum efforts to improve the low level of water supply and\nsanitation of the country.\nAccording to the Annual Progress Report (APR) on the second year of PASDEP\n(2006/07), access to clean water supply at national level increased from 19.1% in\n1995/96 to 52.5% in 2006/07.\nProblems\nLimited physical access of the population to health facilities.\nThe available health care facilities are unevenly distributed across\nregions.\nInadequate budgetary allocation and low levels of management.\nThe distance from, or the absence of, health care facilities.\nLow quality of the facilities.\nMaternal, infant, and child mortality rates are still high.\nThe country has a low resource utilization capacity.\nInadequate and poorly maintained infrastructure and equipment,\nshortage of trained health personnel, and the unavailability of drugs\nand pharmaceutical supplies.\nPossible Remedies\nStrengthen and expand existing health programs.\nProvide family planning services at all levels of health service delivery\nstations.\nStrengthen reproductive health content in health education programs.\nStrengthen and expand training of health personnel in collaboration\nwith relevant institutions.\nSet standards for the provision of family planning services.\nImpacts of HIV/AIDS\nThrough its impacts on the labor force, households, and enterprises, AIDS has\nplayed a more negative role in human development than any other single factor.\nOne aspect of this impact has been the damage that the epidemic has done to the\neconomy, which, in turn, has made it more difficult for the country to respond to\nthe crisis.\nOne way in which AIDS affects the economy, in Ethiopia and other countries,\nis by reducing the labor supply through increased mortality and illness. Even\namong those who are able to work, productivity is likely to decline as a result of\nHIV-related illness. Government income also declines, as tax revenues fall and\nit is forced to increase its spending to deal with the spread of the HIV epidemic.\nThe abilities of African countries to diversify their industrial bases, expand\nexports and attract foreign investment are integral to economic progress in the\nregion. By making labor more expensive and reducing profits, AIDS limits the\nability of African countries to attract industries that depend on low-cost labor\nand makes investment in African businesses less desirable. HIV/AIDS therefore\nthreaten the foundations of economic development in Africa.\nThe impact that AIDS has had on the economies of African countries is difficult to\nmeasure. The economies of the worst affected countries were already struggling\nwith development challenges, debt, and declining trade before the epidemic\nstarted to affect the continent. AIDS has been huge addition to these factors\nfurther aggravating the situation. It is thought that the impact of AIDS on the\ngross domestic product (GDP) of the worst affected countries is a loss of around\n1.5% per year. In othr words, after 25 years the economy would be 31% smaller\nthan it would otherwise have been.",

Transportation\nis fundamental to civilization. The roles of transportation in socio-economic\ndevelopment are that it allows for:\nDivision of labor and labor specialization,\nProcurement of raw materials from various sources,\nDispatch of goods to marketplaces, etc.\nIn Ethiopia, the early means of transportation were foot and pack animals like\ndonkeys, horses, and camels. These means of transportation are important even\ntoday, especially in rural areas. However, this set of transportation constrains\nthe socio-economic development of the country because it is time-taking and\ntiresome.\nDuring the Military Government, the transport sector was put under close state\nregulation and control. The entire commercial truck and passenger transport\nsystem was under strict control of the government through Proclamation\nNo.107/1976.\nThe policy changes in the sector that occurred on May 8, 1992 heralded the\nderegulation of the freight transport industry. Major liberalization of the transport\nindustry began with government Proclamation No. 14/1992. It emphasizes the\npromotion of efficiency and equitable distribution.\nFollowing the 1992 Proclamation, many of the private commercial freight\nand passenger transport activities left the corporation and formed their own\nindependent association.

The authority\nreplaced and took over the rights and obligations of the former Roads Transport\nAdministration. It was again road restructured and replaced by Proclamation No.\n14/92.\nPoverty reduction and addressing vulnerability have been and still are the\noverriding agenda of the government. It is well known that the success of\ndevelopment strategies heavily depends on the efficiency of the infrastructure\nsector in general and the road sub-sector in particular. Accordingly, substantial\nimprovements have been achieved in the expansion of road infrastructure.\nAccording to the 2006/07 Annual Progress Report (APR), in the second year of\nPASDEP implementation (MOFED, 2007), the stock of road network, proportion\nof road network in good condition, and road density per 1000 sq. km increased\nas follows:\nBy the end of 2006/07, the total length of road network (paved and\nunpaved) increased from 23,812 km in 1996/97 to 44,539 km, and road\ndensity increased from 22 km/1000 sq. km in 1996/97 to 40.3 km/ 1000\nsq. km by the end of 2007/08;\nThe proportion of roads in good condition increased from 18 percent\nin 1995/96 to 73 percent by the end of 2007/08. By the end of PASDEP\n(2009/10), the target was to increase road density to the Sub-Saharan\nAfrica (SSA) average of 54 km/1000 square kilometers;\nIn 2006/07, 992 km of new rural roads were constructed and added\ninto the network;\nIn 2006/07, with community participation, 24,353 km of low-level rural\nroads were constructed in different regions of the country;\nThe average time taken to reach all-weather roads reduced from about\n7 hours in 2001/02 to 4.5 in 2006/07. For 2009/10, the target was to\nreduce the average time taken to reach the nearest all-weather road to\n3.5 hours;\nThe proportion of area farther than 5 km away from all-weather roads\nwas reduced to 68 percent by the end of 2006/07 from 72 in 2004/5.\nSee the details in Table 4.9 below.\nSource: Ministry of Finance and Economic Development, 2007.\nII Railways Transport\nFor more than a century, the Ethio-Djibouti Railway has been the nation\u2019s the only\nrailway and one of the most important means of transportation and link to the outside\nworld for Ethiopia. The railway company plays an important role in transporting\nimport, export, and internal freight, and passengers (international and local).\nIn contrast to air transport, Ethiopia has a limited railway service that stretches\n781 km, linking Addis Ababa with the port of Djibouti via the eastern Ethiopian\ncities of Dire Dawa and Adama.\nFinancial operations of the company in the period 2005/06-2008/09 indicate\nthat it gained more from freight than passengers and other sources combined.\nThe data in Table 4.10 reveals that total operating expense the biggest share of\nincome in 2006/07. However, company expenditures exceeded revenue in all of\nthe years. As a result, the company experienced losses from 2005/06 to 2008/09.\nIII Air Transport\nAccording to Ethiopian Airlines Annual Report 2008/09, Ethiopian Airlines was\nfounded on December 29, 1945, by Emperor Haile Selassie I with assistance\nfrom Trans-Continental and Western Airlines (TWA). It commenced operations\non April 8, 1946, with weekly service between Addis Ababa and Cairo with five\nDouglas DC-3 propeller-driven aircraft.\nThe airline started long-flight services to Frankfurt in 1958 and inaugurated its\nfirst jet service in January 1963 from Addis Ababa to Nairobi. In the early 1960s\nit provided some initial aviation support to the Ethio-United States Mapping\nMission in its operation to provide topographic maps of Ethiopia. It is wholly\nowned by the government of Ethiopia and had 4,700 employees as of March\n2007.\nAlthough it relied on American pilots and technicians at the beginning, by its 25th\nanniversary in 1971, Ethiopian Airlines was managed and staffed by Ethiopian\npersonnel. Ethiopian Airlines provided basic pilot and aviation maintenance\ntraining to trainees from African countries including Rwanda, Tanzania, Chad,\nDjibouti, Madagascar and the Sudan. Other training was given to employees of\nKenyan Airways, Air Zimbabwe, Cape Verde Airlines and Air Madagascar.\nEthiopian Airlines has a very good reputation. In its 64 years of service, it has\noffered excellent passenger and cargo air transport. The airline and all its technical\nand training activities have provided an opportunity for building Addis Ababa as\na regional hub for air transport.\nEthiopia had three international and 18 domestic airports. Its international flights\nlink the country with over 45 cities in four continents: 26 in Africa, 12 in Asia, five\nin Europe and two in North America. It has been expanding its intercontinental\nservices to realize its motto of being \u201cAfrica\u2019s Link to the World.\u201d In 2010,\nEthiopian Airlines traveled to 59 international destinations, 39 of which were in\nAfrica. According to Ethiopian Airlines Annual Report (2008/09), the operational\naircraft of Ethiopia airline was 41.\nFinancial Performance of the Company\nRevenue\nThe total revenue generated during the year 2008/09 grew by 33% compared to\nthe revenue of the previous year.\nA Passenger Revenue\nThe actual passenger revenue, including excess baggage, realized in\n2008/09, was 29% higher than in the preceding year, mainly as a result of\nincreased passengers.\nB Flight Revenue\nFreight revenue earned in the 2008/09 fiscal year was higher than that of\nthe previous year by 49%. This was mainly because charter operations to\nand from Europe increased.\nC Operating Expenses\nThe total operation expenses in 2008/09 increased 28% compared to the\nprevious year. The major contributor for this was the increase of costs of\naviation fuel, aircraft leases, and maintenance.\nD Cash Position\nThe airline generated a net cash inflow of ETB 1.4 billion from operating\nactivities, raised ETB 15 million from financing activities, and spent ETB\n1.1 billion for investments.\nIn 2008/2009, the airline transported 2.8 million passengers and generated 12.2\nbillion birr in revenue with a net profit of 1.345 billion birr (a 165% increase over\nthe previous year). In the same period, Ethiopian Airlines hauled 101 thousand\ntons of cargo, a 38.4% increase over the previous year. These results were the best\nyet for the 64-year-old airline, and were attributed to an aggressive marketing\ncampaign and major cost-cutting measures.\nIV Ethiopian Shipping Lines S.C.\nEthiopian Shipping Lines (ESLSC) was established in March 10, 1964 under the\nagreement of the Imperial Ethiopian Government and Taurus Investment Inc.,\nwhose head office was in Washington DC, USA. According to the agreement\nsigned, Ethiopian Shipping Lines Share Company was established in Ethiopia\nwith an initial capital of 50,000 Ethiopian Birr, subsequently to be raised to\n3,750,000 Ethiopian Birr. Taurus Investment Inc agreed to subscribe to 51%\nof the capital requirements and designated two directors of the company. The\nEthiopian Government underwriote the remaining 49% of the capital required\nand designated two directors of the ESL.\nAfter the agreement was singed, the first three vessels were ordered. The two\ncargo liners, the M.V. \u201cLion of Judah\u201d and the M.V. \u201cQueen of Sheba\u201d and a\n34,000 ton oil tanker m/t \u201cLalibela\u201d were ceremoniously launched at Rotterdam\nin 1966. Since then, the Etho-Shipping Lines Share Company (ESLSC) has\nundertaken an extensive fleet expansion program to keep pace with the nation\u2019s\nrising need for shipping services.\nThe ESLSC, which was again established, under the decree of Council of\nMinisters Regulation No. 196/1994, had authorized the company a capital of\n122,000,000 Birr.\nThe main purpose of the establishment of the company has been to:\nRender coastal and international marine transport service, and\nEngage in other related activities necessary for the attainment of its\ncharter.\nBesides its former and current fleet, ESLSC has made slot charter arrangements\nagreements with a number of other shipping companies. This global practice\nenables ESLSC to give weekly service from any of its trading routes.\nEthiopian Shipping Lines Enterprise is a domestic company, which is mainly\nengaged in transporting commercial goods from country to country through its\ninternational routes.\nPertaining to the continuous growth of the country\u2019s economy, in general, and\nforeign trade cargo, in particular, ESLSC\u2019s performance registered steady growth\nduring 1995, 1996, 1997, 1998, 1999, 2000, 2001, and 2002 (Ethiopian fiscal\nyears), as indicated in Table 4.11.\nThe financial operation of the Ethiopian Shipping Line Enterprise for\nthe years EFY 1995-2002 is presented in Table 4.11. Revenues and\nexpenditures of the enterprise for that period were at their peak in\n2002 EFY, and were at their lowest in 1995/96. The company gained a profit of\nBirr 64,1363 million in 2002 EFY.",

Communication\nservices include telecommunication, postal and media services.\nUpgrading and expanding the telecommunications network and services have\nbeen essential to modernizing the sector and bringing about national growth\nas well as greatly supporting the rural economy. For example, having basic\ntelephone access in villages:\nallows farmers to get information on prices for their crops and livestock\nproducts;\nimproves the efficiency of local administration;\nencourages the development of trade and small businesses;\nfacilitates the provision of social services such as health, education,\nand agricultural extension.\nThe history of the communication service in Ethiopia dates back to 1894 when\nvarious innovations were introduced in Ethiopia during the time of Emperor\nMenelik II.\nA telegraph line from Addis Abeba to Djibouti was installed parallel to the\nconstruction of the then Franco-Ethiopian Railway, which was commenced in\n1898 and completed in 1917.\nUntil 1904, communication services were supervised by a foreign adviser but\nlater, as telephone and telegraph lines were found to be vital for administrative\nand foreign-relation purposes and for the dissemination of news, communication\nfacilities began to be run by an office in the Imperial Palace and were accorded\nthe direct attention and supervision of Emperor Menelik II himself, assisted by a\nforeign expert, M. Chefneux.\nThe first telecommunication and postal administration started in 1909 and was\ncompleted in 1911. It was the cornerstone of the establishment of the Ministry of\nPostal, Telegraph and Telephone (MOPTT).\nAfter the establishment of MOPTT, Ethiopia became a member of the Universal\nPostal Union (UPU) and the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) in\nthe years 1908 and 1932, respectively.\nIn the period from 1915 to 1932, there were only 200 telephone subscribers in\nAddis Abeba. The first telephone subscriber in Addis Abeba was the then Bank\nof Abyssinia.\nFollowing the end of the Italian occupation of Ethiopia (in 1941), the first\nautomatic telephone exchange system was installed in Addis Abeba and Asmera.\nIn 1981, the Board of Telecommunication was renamed as the Ethiopian\nTelecommunication Service Organization without much change in its functions.\nThis name lasted for over 5 years and in 1981, the organization came to be known\nas the \u201cEthiopian Telecommunication Authority\u201d.\nAs to postal services, Proclamation No. 240/1996 set the administrative\ninfrastructure for the improvement, expansion, and modernization of the\nEthiopian postal system. Under this Proclamation, the post office was organized\nas an independent department of the MOPTT.\nAs to the development of media service in Ethiopia, the press was the pioneer in\nthis area. And it is one of the media used for relaying information to the public\nand to exchange news, views, ideas, etc.\nAs the data shows, the numbers of copies of Addis Zemmen and the Ethiopian\nHerald sold were 4.4 million and 2.6 million in 1998/99, respectively, and it rose\nto 5.8 million copies of Addis Zemmen and 3 million copies of the Ethiopian\nHerald in 2002/03, (Ministry of Information and Culture, 2002/03 EFY).\nTelevision service was established in 1964. The service was confined to Addis\nAbaba. Additional TV stations were not installed until 1992. Television service\ncoverage had reached up to 35% of the total area of the country by the end of\nthe Derg regime. After the downfall of the Derg, 39 additional towns got TV\nservices. By the year 2006, the TV penetration rate in Ethiopia had reached up to\n55% of the total area of the country.",

It was the recognition of this great potential that encouraged Ethiopia in the 1960\u2019s to start a tourism industry. After an initial period of rapid growth, the industry underwent a fast decline and stagnation for many years due to the political and economic problems that prevailed for a long time in the history of the country.\nDuring the Derg government (from 1974 to 1991), Ethiopia\u2019s tourism industry suffered from the adverse effects of a prolonged civil war, recurrent drought and famine, strained government relations with tourist-generating countries, and restrictions on the entry and movements of tourists. However, tourism is now operating in a more conducive climate for growth and development, as evidenced by statistics compiled by the Ethiopian Tourism Commission.\nBecause Ethiopia has so many historical and natural sites and diverse cultural-tourism attractions, tourism should have been one of the country\u2019s largest industries, but unfortunately the country has been unable to realize the economic benefits it deserves from the sector. Nonetheless, in recent years, due to the development of infrastructures, like roads and hotels, and to the crucial role of the government in marketing and changing the image of the country through its embassies, tourism has shown significant growth despite the economic crisis in the world.

The government is committed to developing tourism through a number of initiatives. Tourism is a featured component of Ethiopia\u2019s Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP), which aims to combat poverty and encourage economic development.\nDeveloped in the 1960s, tourism declined greatly in the late 1970s and the 1980s under the Military Government. Its recovery began in the 1990s, but growth has been constrained by lack of suitable hotels and other infrastructure, (despite a boom in the construction of small-and medium-sized hotels and restaurants) and by the effects of drought and political instability.\nOne encouraging aspect is the growing popularity of eco-tourism, which has significant potential for growth in Ethiopia. Travel retail sales are expected to continue to grow. They posted an increase of 7% in 2006.\nIn 2007, a total of 357,841 tourists came to Ethiopia. Among them, about 311,943 came via Addis Ababa Bole International Airport, while the rest, an estimated 45,898, entered through other entry ports of the country, namely Dire Dawa, by air, and Moyale, Galafi and Metema, by road.\nIn terms of world regions that are Ethiopia\u2019s sources of tourists, the proportions of tourist arrivals that came through Bole International Airport in 2007 were: Africa 30.3%, Europe 26.3%, America 21.9%, the Middle East 10%, Asia 10.3% and Oceania 1.2%. Therefore, Africa, Europe and America were the main tourist-generating countries for the year under review. Africa was the first, due to tourists coming for business and transit, while from Europe and America most tourists came dominantly to vacation. When the year\u2019s performance is compared with the those of the preceding two years, the rate of growth for tourist arrivals was lower, compared with the 2005 and 2006 achievements.\nThe 2008 tourist-arrival figure was 383,399, increases of 68.6%, 16.2%, and 7.1%, compared to the 2005, 2006, and 2007 achievements, respectively.\nIn spite of the economic crises in the world, Ethiopia has achieved growth in the sector. In 2008, the best performance was 9% of the arrivals of the year, registered in the month of July.\nThe year 2008 witnessed a significant drop in tourists coming for vacations, compared with 2007. The reason could be the world economic crisis.\nAs indicated in Table 4.16 the years of 2005/04, 2006/05, 2007/06 showed double-digit growth rates for vacation tourists. On the other hand, as seen in Table 4.17, vacation tourists for 2008 decreased by 22.7%, which is a significant slowdown, compared with the 2007 accomplishment.\nAlthough the Americas are one of the major tourist-generating countries for Ethiopia, their performances of 2008 declined by 3.4% and 13.3%, compared with those of 2006 and 2007. This could be attributed to the slowdown in the Americas economy in the year under review.\nAccording to the World Tourism Organization (UNWTO, November 2008/09), despite the decline in the world economy, tourist arrivals in Ethiopia in 2008 showed growth, as mentioned above, demonstrating an exception to the growth for most other countries in the world.\nAs a proportion of Ethiopia\u2019s gross domestic product (GDP), tourism declined from 1.09% in 2007 to 0.77% in 2008. Growth in tourism consumption was driven by increases in the number of tourist arrivals, especially increases in the number of vacation tourists.\nIn 2008, the growth rate in tourism receipts dropped by 4.2%, unlike the continuous growth from 1998 to 2007, reflecting the slowdown in the world economy.\nNot all of Ethiopia\u2019s attractions are widely known, but some are quite famous. Indeed, eight national attractions have been recognized by UNESCO as world heritage sites: Axum\u2019s obelisks, Gondar\u2019s castles, the island monasteries on Lake Tana, Hadar (where Lucy was discovered), Tia\u2019s carved standing stones, the walls of Harer, the Semien National Park and rock hewen Lalibela Church. Ethiopia\u2019s policy welcomes all tourists, regardless of their national origin, creed or belief, color or economic standing. However, in light of the tourist facilities available at present and the probable carrying capacities of some of the well -known attractions, much promotion is aimed at the moment at the rather affluent market. Future developments and promotions will include a wider spectrum of the international market.",

        "chunk_text": "Ethiopian trade was started during the time of the Axumite Kingdom. During this time, the state obtained considerable income from both domestic and international trade. Trade took its modern shape under the regime of Emperor Menilik II. Trading activities that took place once a week in traditional markets were supplemented with the opening of small shops in towns. A particular impetus in domestic trade was attained with the construction of railway lines from Djibouit to Addis Ababa, thereby increasing the number and types of commodities available for sale. Due to cultural influence, and lack of adequate capital and knowledge, almost all of the modern shops were owned and run by foreign nationals (Armenians, Arabs, etc.). International trade was facilitated through a network of trading routes from Adulis and other trading posts on the Red Sea coast. These trading routes were frequently used by both domestic and international traders and made the flow of goods and services to and from the country possible.\nAfter the end of the Italian invasion, the modernization of domestic trade achieved a landmark. A responsible ministry, aware of its duties and responsibilities, backed by various rules and regulations for efficient operation, was set up. Institutions were also set up to provide training to Ethiopians who might enter the fields of trade and commerce. Above all, a commercial code was introduced in order to enforce laws governing business transactions. The business environment advanced greatly until the 1974 Revolution.\nAfter the takeover of power by the Derg, the whole system of economic management, including domestic trade, changed greatly. Mass nationalization took place. Every activity of the national economy was guided under central planning: profit motives gave way to social objectives. Every measure to strengthen the socialization process was encouraged and, if necessary, subsidized. The economy ultimately stagnated and demanded change. The reform measures that were started during the last years of the Military regime were not adequate enough to bring about the demanded change. And, as a necessity, a radical change in all spheres (economic, political and social) took place with the overthrow of the Derg in 1991. Since then, many important reform measures have been undertaken, based on the economic policies of the transitional period and on a number of most recent policy measures, rules, regulations and directives were issued to bring back a business environment governed by market law.",

        "chunk_text": "Trade deals with business transactions that take place between households, firms, and governments. It can be divided into two: domestic and international trade. Domestic trade refers to pure exchange activities within a national boundary. Domestic trade encourages the diffusion of knowledge, culture, and religion. As such, domestic trade fosters specialization in which each locality or region specializes in the production of specific commodities, thereby creating interdependence among regions. The whole basis of domestic trade rests on the fact that localities or regions differ in their resource endowments and in their economic and social features and capacities for growth and development.\nInternational trade, on the other hand, can be defined as the exchange of goods and services among citizens of independent or sovereign countries. People are better off when they have trade than when they are without trade.\nThere are many factors accountable for the rise of international trade. Some of them are differences in resource endowment, demand, and economies of scale and specialization. For example, the differences in resource endowments lead to differences in relative costs in the production of goods and services among countries. Economies of scale provide additional cost incentives for specialization in production. That is, instead of manufacturing only a few units of each and every product that domestic consumers desire to purchase, a country specializes in the manufacture of large amounts of a limited number of goods and trades for the remaining goods. Specialization in a few products allows a manufacturing sub-sector to benefit from longer production runs, which leads to decreasing average costs.\nWhile demand patterns seem to be similar throughout the world, especially among similar socio-economic income classes, differences in tastes and preferences certainly exist. For example, in country A, where demand is oriented toward steel, the price of steel that intensively uses the relatively abundant factor is relatively higher than its price in the trading country B. With the opening of trade, country A would find itself exporting cloth and importing steel from country B because B\u2019s steel is relatively cheaper at international prices. This occurs because demand in country A for the product using the abundant factor intensively leads to a high price for that product and the factor used intensively in its production that the physically abundant factor is the scarce factor from the standpoint of price definition. Because this is the result of a particular set of demand conditions, it is referred to as demand reversal.\nInternational trade allows a country to specialize and export those goods and services that it can produce at relatively low cost and import those goods and services whose domestic production is relatively costly. As a consequence, international trade enables a country to consume and produce more than would be possible without trade. In other words, international trade enlarges the consumption choice of people by allowing them to consume those goods which they cannot produce. Unlike domestic trade, international trade provides foreign goods and services that cannot be produced within the domestic economy. International trade also encourages the diffusion of knowledge and culture because trade serves as a point of contact between people of different countries. International trade also encourages specialization, and creates interdependence among countries.",

In other words, the dominance of the government in manufacturing, distribution, transportation and finance was the order of the day. This measure of nationalization stifled the rising participation of national entrepreneurs in all sectors. After nationalizing and restructuring trade organizations, the government reorganized them into wholesale and retail trading corporations and enterprises under the supervision of the then Ministry of Domestic Trade. The participation of private organizations in domestic wholesale trading activities was very limited. For instance, in food grain marketing, merchants in Arssi, Bale and Gojam were banned altogether. In Gondar and Wollega, grain merchants had to surrender all their purchases to the government-owned Agricultural Marketing Corporation (AMC), while in other surplus-producing areas, such as Shoa, they surrendered 50 percent of their annual purchases to the corporation. In the domestic wholesale trade of manufactured products, the Ethiopian Domestic Distribution Corporation (EDDC) had a monopoly, and private traders were forced to take part in the trading of items with slow rates of turnover allocated to them by the corporation.",

As the ownership policy was based on socialist ideology, the distribution policy was in favor of socialized sectors. Those sectors under public ownership and cooperatives were given priority in the distribution of goods and services. The private sector, on the other hand, was only entitled to the residual. For instance, from 1985/86 to 1991/92, EDDC sold, on the average, 31 percent of its sales to private traders, while the rest went to socialized sectors. Moreover, all of AMC sales were directed to government institutions and urban-dweller associations. The most important strategies employed in the distribution of basic or essential goods for which shortage was common were quota allocation and rationing. Basic commodities such as sugar, wheat flour, salt, etc. were under strict quota allocation. The then existing administrative regions received their quotas by EDDC, depending on supply. After the quota allocation, rationing was implemented, mainly through urban-dweller associations and service cooperatives, to final consumers, depending again on supply and on family size. But urban dwellers who were not registered in kebele associations were not entitled even to rationing and, as a result, they were forced to buy those basic commodities at very high prices from private shops. Likewise, the movement of food grains from region to region by private traders was strictly forbidden. Only AMC had the mandate to move grains between regions, although other public organizations got permission to do so when a need arose. Restriction on the movement of food grains by private traders had the following impacts: It adversely affected the consumers in deficit areas by pushing up grain prices. It eroded incentives for producers in surplus areas by depressing prices. It hindered both the expansion of marketed supplies and the development of an integrated national market, which were very important for the country\u2019s economic development. In January 1988, the government announced that private traders would be issued permits to move grain as long as they agreed to sell half of their purchases to AMC at AMC buying prices. As of late 1988, there were reports of some private traders moving grain in some areas. However, there was a disincentive to trade in cases where the official prices at which traders had to sell to AMC were lower than the local prices at which they purchased the grains.",

In this section, the pricing policies followed with regard to manufacturing and agricultural commodities will be reviewed. The prices of manufactured products, which were considered very basic and in short supply were determined by the Ministry of Domestic Trade and announced to consumers through public notices. These commodities could be imported and/ or domestically produced. After price determination, price control was the next step. The prices of other manufactured products were determined on a cost-plus basis. However, this mechanism of price determination had its own limitation as it allowed inefficiencies of manufacturing and trading enterprises to be transmitted to consumers in the form of additional costs. More problems were observed in the pricing mechanism of agricultural commodities or food grains. Based on the cost-of-production study undertaken by the Ministry of Agriculture, national farm-gate and wholesale prices of food grains were introduced in 1980/81. These fixed prices continued to be operational in the purchasing activity of AMC until 1987/88, when a minor increase in price modification was introduced. The upward price revision ranged from 6 to 10 percent, depending on the type of crop.

According to the proclamation: Trading activity was allowed only to proprietorships; There was no licensing to government employees; Wholesaling was limited to the capital ceiling of Birr 300,000 and retailing to Birr 200,000; An individual could get licensed only in the region in which he/she resided; Only one business license and one business undertaking were permitted to an individual. Branch establishment was prohibited; and License provision was tied to supply conditions. These restrictive licensing conditions for private traders were relaxed with the introduction of mixed economy policies during the dying hours of the Derg Regime. Following the relaxation of restrictive licensing conditions, a great many new wholesale, retail, and service licenses were issued to individuals and business associations. For instance, new licenses issued in 1988/89 before the relaxation of licensing restrictions were 3,163, and this number went up to 30,729 in 1990/91\u2014 that is, after the relaxation of those restrictive licensing conditions. With the overthrow of the Derg by the EPRDF and the establishment of the Transitional Government of Ethiopia (TGE) in mid-1991, changes took place in the political, economic, and social conditions of the country. Rules that encouraged the functioning of the market were institutionalized, with some government intervention when necessary. The importance and constructive role of the private sector in the national economy was better appreciated and an enabling environment for its operation was created. The foundation for the changes observed was laid down with the adoption of the country\u2019s new economic policies during the transitional period.

However, there was public doubt regarding the continuity of the system because there was still a heavy government hand in all sectors of the economy. The first most important step taken after the Derg was the removal of restrictions on traders. Private traders were allowed to operate side-by-side with government parastatals. Controls on inter-regional grain movement were also removed and, as a result, price differentials between surplus and deficit areas narrowed. The quota system for grain purchases was abolished. The adoption of the new economic policy and the subsequent measures taken under the New Economic Reform Program further consolidated the reform measures started in 1990 and introduced additional ones. This time, the reform measures were well rounded, ranging from macroeconomic to sectoral policies, and they were radical enough to bring structural change to the whole economy. As a result of the liberalization measures undertaken so far in domestic trade: New entrants as well as established traders can move food grains freely from market to market; Obtaining licenses and legal recognition are relatively easy; The activities of parastatals a shrinkage in their purchase and distribution network; the traditional private marketing system has revived; types of markets and market channels in both rural and urban areas are diversified; private trade appears to be deficient in making goods available in time and place, compared with public sector trade; better quality grains are shipped to the central markets as prices are permitted to reflect widely accepted perceptions of quality differences; the producer-consumer price margin has narrowed, due to a sharp increase in producer prices, without change in the already inflated consumer prices; markets have started to experience price fluctuations related to supply and demand; and as can be observed from the trend in the number of new domestic trade licenses issued, (for both wholesale and retail trade) the volume of commodities handled and the number of participants in private trade have increased since the launching of the reform.",

Mobilizing government revenue by imposing taxes on imports and exports, Protecting domestic economy participants from foreign competition, Maintaining a favorable balance of payments at a sustainable level, and The gradual prevention of the private sector from foreign trade participation. Consistent with the last objective, the government discouraged private importers and exporters from exporting traditional export items, such as coffee, pulses, oil seeds, and the like. Public enterprises were established to run such activities. During this regime: Exporters were not allowed to export commodities at prices less than the reference prices provided by the government. Exporters were also forced to surrender 100 percent of the foreign exchange they obtained to the government. There was a restrictive foreign exchange licensing system for private use. The exchange rate was fixed at Birr 2.07 for a dollar for quite a long period of time. The government provided marketing channels for all imports and major exports of the country. However, after the overthrow of the Derg, the TGE started taking a number of foreign trade policy measures in 1992. The government changed the fixed exchange rate regime to that of a managed floating exchange rate regime (that is, a rate determined by the market). introduced a bi-weekly foreign exchange auction market in May 1993. Currently, this auction system is changed on a daily basis. The marginal rate (the market clearing rate) established at the auction used to be used as a secondary rate applicable to all current and capital account transactions until the next auction, with the exception of a limited number of payments for which the foregoing exchange rate was made available at the official rate. However, the two rates were unified on July 25, 1995, and a weekly foreign exchange auction was introduced a year later. In August 1998, the government replaced the retail auction market with wholesale auctioning in which commercial banks, the foreign exchange bureau, and investors in need of large amounts of foreign exchange (above USD 500,000 per auction) could participate. An inter-bank market for foreign exchange has also been introduced and is still practiced. The other main external trade reform measure was the suspension of taxes and duties levied on exports, except on coffee. It was introduced in January 1993. But the tax on coffee was also removed after the recent historic coffee price decline in order to reduce the adverse effects of this price decline on coffee growers and other citizens participating in the coffee market. This tax removal on export of all commodities together with the devaluation, provides a strong incentive to exporters because it allows them to receive the equivalent of world prices for exports. Government subsidies to exporters were also terminated when export taxes were lifted. Complementary to this measure, the government introduced an export duty- drawback scheme in August 1993 to further encourage investment in the production of exportable item. There were two versions in this incentive scheme. Furthermore, within the framework of promoting exports, the following measures were undertaken: Reducing license fees for coffee exporters and simplifying the procedure for getting licenses. An action program for the liberalization of the coffee sector has also been developed. Since 1996/97, the government has reduced the 100 percent foreign exchange surrender requirement on exporters to the National Bank of Ethiopia to 50 percent and allowed the exporters to open foreign exchange saving accounts at commercial banks and save 10 percent of their proceeds for a given transaction. The remaining 40 percent of their earnings is to be exchanged for Birr within three weeks at a rate they find favorable. This saving is to be used for investment and other expenditures related to the development of the export sector. With respect to import trade liberalization, the government has been introducing policies step-by-step or gradually. For example, Maximum import duties were lowered from 280 percent to 80 percent during the first move of import liberalization and currently stands at 50 percent. In addition, efforts are being made to correct legal and administrative impediments to import liberalization through a simplification of the system of granting import licenses and permits. In line with the government\u2019s policy to build a market-based economy, the external sector has also benefited from the abolition of monopolistic operations of public enterprises, which used to dominate the export and import sector alike. Since then, the private sector has been encouraged (including by the simplification of entry to market) to participate in the external sector.",

The first term states that when the raw material or commodity on which duty is to be drawn-back is re-exported in the same condition, 95% of the duty will be refunded. The second term stipulates that if the raw material or commodity on which duty is to be drawn-back is exported after being processed or used for packing or containing, 100% of the duty will be refunded.

During the late 1980\u2019s and\nearly 1980\u2019s, however, a clear trend of decline in export earnings was observed.\nExport earnings during this period declined so drastically that they financed only\n17 % of imports in 1991/92. In absolute terms, export earnings declined from\nUSD 443.6 million in 1988/89 to USD 154.2 million in 1991/92.\nThe introduction of the reform measures in 1992 seemed to have a positive impact\non export performance. Export earnings showed continuous revival in the years\nfollowing the reform, reaching a level of USD 453.6 million in 1994/95, restoring\nexport earning and the capacity of financing imports back to the 1988/89 level,\n43 %. The relative importance that a considerable growth in export earnings was\nparticularly registered in 1994/95. It was documented that a considerable growth\nin export earnings was occurred in 1994/95, mainly due to windfall gains from\nan increase in the world price for coffee. A marginal decline in export earnings\nwas observed in 1995/96, which was mainly attributed to the decline of world\ncoffee prices in that year. Export earnings, on average, showed an increasing\ntrend during the post-reform period. For instance, total export earnings increased\nfrom Birr 923.8 million in 1985/86 to Birr 3,511.6 million in 1998/99. Moreover,\nnon-coffee earnings accounted for 34.5 % of the total export earnings, while\ncoffee accounted for the remaining earning\u2019s during the post-reform period.\nIn the year 2003, export earnings were Birr 4,470.9 million indicating a close\nto 27% increase from its level in 1998/99. But they could finance only around\n19.4% of the import bills in 2003. Total merchandise exports reached USD 1.45\nbillion in 2008/09, about 1.2 % lower than the previous years exports. Earnings\nfrom coffee, pulses, leather products, and fruits and vegetables tended to falter.\nExport receipts from coffee declined by 28.3% as a result of lower volume and\ninternational price. The volume of coffee exports went down to 21.5% due to\nproblems associated with the domestic trading system, to lower demand in the\ninternational market following the global economic recession, and to the import\nban by Japan, the second largest buyer of Ethiopian coffee. Consequently, the\nshare of coffee in total exports fell to 26% from 35.8% a year earlier.\nSimilarly, export revenue from pulses dropped to 36.8% because of the 40.8%\nfall in the volume of exports, despite a 6.7% increase in international prices.\nThus, the share of pulses in total exports shrank from 9.8% to 6.3% during the\nperiod under consideration.\nThe global economic downturn worsened. Export earnings from leather and\nleather products fell to 24.1% as the volume of exports went down by 51%\nin spite of a significant rise in international prices. On the other hand, export\nearnings from oil seeds, the second largest export item, increased by 62.8% due\nto 88.7% surge in volume, offsetting the 13.7% decline in international price.\nConsequently, the share of oil seeds in the total exports rose to 24.6% from 14.9%\nin the preceding fiscal year.\nSimilarly, due to increased export to the Middle East and better international\nprices, revenues from meat and meat products and from live animals went up\nby 27.3% and 28.9%, respectively. Despite fears of the global economic crisis,\nexport revenue from flowers improved by 16.9% in 2008/09 as a result of\nhigher volumes of exports to different destinations, despite a marginal decline in\ninternational prices. Exports of chat and gold also fared well. Revenue from these\nitems rose by 28.1% and 24.2%, reaching USD 138.7 million and 97.8 million,\nrespectively in 2008/09.",

The rise in non-\ndurable consumer goods was due to increased imports of cereals, and of medical\nand pharmaceutical products. Consequently, the share of consumer goods in total\nimports in the same year (2008/09) grew to 30.3% percent, compared to 22.3% in\n2007/08.

        "chunk_text": "National debt is an accumulation of annual loans entered between the Ethiopian government and creditor nations and lending institutions. National debt can be domestic or external or both. Domestic debt is the accumulation of annual loans that the government borrows from domestic financial institutions, whereas external debt refers to the accumulation of annual loans that the government borrows from international financial markets. Domestic debt is the amount of public sector borrowing from different banks and other financial institutions in the country. This might have a crowding out effect (a reduction in private sector borrowing and spending caused by increased government borrowing) when looking into the predomination of the public sector within the financial market and reducing the real credit to the private sector. When deficit persists and is financed by domestic borrowing, the servicing capacity of the public sector will eventually be questionable. The origin of external debt could be traced to the willingness of the debtor countries to borrow and the lenders to lend. National debt service is simply the amount of foreign exchange required to repay the debt and the interest on the debt. It has been indicated that foreign borrowing allows a country to invest and consume beyond the limit of current domestic production. However, inappropriate and excessive foreign borrowing will generate debt service obligation that will constrain future economic policy and growth. The debt servicing burden is simply the amount of foreign exchange required to pay the external debt and the interest on the debt, which shows an upward trend over time. The external debt profile of Ethiopia showed remarkable changes in its magnitude in the period between 1991/02 and 2008/09 as shown in Table 5.8. As indicated in Table 5.8, the size of external debt grew until 1998/99, thus imposing a higher debt service ratio (the ratio of principal and interest payment on external debt that it had to export goods and non-factor services) that was beyond the service capacity of the country. The available documents indicate that the size of external debt was USD 371 million in 1974/75 and that it had increased to USD 10.2 billion by the end of 1998. However, following the huge discount made by the Russian Federation, the total debt stock of the country was reduced by half and stood at USD 5.45 billion at the end of 1999. By the end of 2008/09, Ethiopia\u2019s stock of external debt reached USD 3.3 billion, 20% higher than the previous year. As shown in Table 5.9, between 2005 and 2008/09, external debt as a proportion of GDP declined from 12.3% to 10.5%. The ratio of the stock of debt to export of goods and non-factor services, however, showed no significant change over the last year. Debt owed to multilateral creditors constituted 61.4% of the total debt, and increase by 32.5%. Similarly, debt owed to bilateral creditors rose 7.8% and accounted for 30.9% of the total debt. On the other hand, commercial debt, which accounted for just 7.7% of the total debt, showed a 7.6% decline. The debt service ratio fell from 2.5% in 2007/08 to 1.4% in 2008/09 as a result of lower debt service payments. However, the debt burden did not exhibit a decline. This was mainly because export earnings were less than what the country paid for imports, which created debt accumulation. As indicated earlier, export earnings were much lower than import bills, producing a huge deficit in the current account balance and creating a balance-of-payments problem for the country. Thus, debt accumulation and repayment retards economic growth. In other words, our economic growth would have been higher had it not been for the draining of foreign exchange to service the debt.",

In a very rudimentary sense, the economic dimension of globalization entails the process of integrating an economy with world markets. The economic interdependence that results from such process encompasses both product market (a market where goods and services are bought and sold) and factor market (a market where resources such as labor, capital, land etc., are bought and sold) and involves transactions in goods and services, investment and finance. The overriding principle underlying globalization is beneficial to all parties in an environment of voluntary exchange on the bases of comparative advantage, which in turn is enhanced through specialization.

Challenges If proper policies are not in place, especially in the transition period, globalization may be hazardous to less developed countries\u2019 economic health. Some of these economic-health risks include: Weakening or destroying whatever little productive capacity there is, particularly in the manufacturing sector, due to world competition. Complete vulnerability of the domestic economy to external shocks. Loss of the sovereignty of governments to address distributional and other social issues as they see it fit. This is because World Trade Organization (WTO) rules and the significant role of transnational would directly or indirectly put a constraint on what policies governments could pursue, and Trigger competitive devaluation and unproductive competition among the least developed countries, since most of them have similar endowments and comparative advantages. For instance, both Kenya and Ethiopia mainly rely on the export of coffee and tea. Economic integration is making international trade increasingly free by reducing (in some cases, eliminating) traditional trade barriers. Trade integration is one part of the large range of economic integration activities, which include integration of macroeconomic policies and freedom of factor movements as well as free trade between member nations. The motives underlying the drive towards economic co-operation among countries are varied. Apart from those shaped by historical and cultural circumstances, the search for economic development and the expression of political solidarity have been prominent among them. Economic co-operation\u2019s attractions are largely due to the advantages it offers through the enlargement of economic size and improvements in efficiency, and through the extension of the range and complementarity of resources available among countries. Expected economic gains from regional economic integration are: increased production arising from specialization according to comparative advantages, increased output arising from improved exploitation of scale economies. improvement in terms of trade with the rest of the world. For example, trade between the EU and the USA, Japan, etc. In Africa there are different regional forms of economic integration, which include these collaborations: PTA (the Preferential Trade Area). The PTA was established in 1982. It has 19 member countries, and Ethiopia is one of them. Another regional integration is the ECOWAS (the Economic Community of West African States). It was founded in 1975 and has 16 member countries. The SADCC (the Southern Africa Development Coordination Conference), and The COMESA (the Common Market for East and Southern Africa).",

Therefore, the government takes the responsibility of:\n  providing of public goods and social services;\n  regulating the economy as its role.\nThe other functions that the government serves are as follows:\n  Alteration of the structure of private production. In order to conform to some conception of the allocation of resources; this is considered \u2018better\u2019 than the resulting from private market transactions. This aim will be reflected in the choice of taxes levied on goods and services (example, taxes on expenditure), in corporation taxes and in current subsidies.\n  Intervention in the distribution of income generated by private market transactions in order to conform to some acceptable criterion of equity; for example, a minimum income guarantee. This will be reflected in the national accounts principally in the choice of taxes and in the provision of transfer payments to households against which there is no counter flow of current services. For example, state pension payments are transfer payments, and though pensioners do not render current services in order to receive them, they may have contributed to their finance through compulsory levies on their past incomes. Transfer payments do not form a direct link between government and industry but major efforts by government to alter income distribution have considerable influence on the structure of household purchases and, therefore, on the pattern of demand for industrial products.\n  Stabilization of the economy by attempting to reduce fluctuations in income and employment and to control movements in the general price level. The effects of this action can be seen in both the volume and the mix of transactions between the government and the rest of the economy.\nIn general, government roles can be summarized as follows:\n  Promoting economic growth;\n  Providing public goods and service, such as defence, judicial service highways, streetlight, education and health care service and others;\n  Bring about equitable distribution of income;\n  Stabilize the economy, through such measures as controlling inflation, reducing unemployment, avoidance of regional imbalance, fair or equitable distribution of income, and promoting economic growth;\n  Regulating the externalities;\n  Promoting efficiency;\n  Maintenance of law and order; and\n  Reduction of poverty.",

The government adopted special tax increase policies in both direct and indirect taxes to discourage the private sector. In this period ,the rise in government expenditure on defense , strong involvement of government into the economy, overall expansion of the public sector, high degree of centralization and mismanagement of economic resources have led to considerable increase in government expenditure.\nAfter the fall of the Derg EPRDF has been forced to take different measures. Most of these measures focused on the revenue and expenditure reform which increase government revenue and reduce government expenditure. The measures taken helped to remove the budget deficit.\nFiscal policy is a policy of government that guides the revenue and expenditure of a government. Fiscal policy instruments are tax and expenditure items.\nThe roles and functions of fiscal policy in the economy can be outlined in the following ways:\n  The allocation of resources into the production of public and private goods.\n  The distribution of income in order to reduce inequality and poverty.\n  The promotion of economic growth and the stabilization of the economy by reducing fluctuation in the level of prices, output and employment.",

Revenue budget consists of the annual forecast of government budget from tax, non-tax, external assistance and capital source of revenue.\nTax-Source of Government Revenue\nA Ordinary revenue\ni Direct tax: The term direct tax means a tax paid directly to the government by the persons on whom it is imposed. Examples include income taxes, such as the following.\n  Personal income tax: Every person deriving income from employment in any government or other private organization or non-governmental organization and income from employment including any payments or gain in cash or in kind which he/she received from employees.\n  Business Income Tax: Is a tax imposed on business enterprises, professional or vocational activity or any other activity recognized as trade pays tax based on their profit.\n  Corporate tax: refers to a direct tax levied on the profits made by companies or associations and often includes capital gains of a company.\n  An inheritance tax (also known as an estate tax): is a tax which arises on the death of an individual. It is a tax on the estate, or total value of the money and property, of a person who has died.\n  Transfer tax: a tax on the passing of title of property from one person (or entity) to another.\n  Tax on dividends: is an income tax on dividend payments to the stockholders (shareholders) of a company.\n  Income from games of chance: Every person deriving income from winning at games of chance \u2013 for example, lotteries, tombolas, and other similar activities, are subject to tax at the rate of fifteen percent /15%/ except for winnings of less than 100 Birr.\n  Rental income tax: Rental income is any payment you receive for the use or occupation of property.\n  Interest Income on Deposits: Every person deriving income from interest on deposits shall pay tax at the rate of five percent.\nii Indirect tax: a tax levied indirectly, as one levied on commodities before they reach the consumer but ultimately paid by the consumer as part of the market price. Examples includes sales tax or value added tax (VAT).\n  Value added tax (VAT): is a sales tax based on the increase in value or price of product at each stage in its manufacture and distribution and the cost of the tax in added at the final price and eventually paid by consumer on the purchase price of 15%.\n  Sales tax: a consumption tax charged at the point of purchase for certain goods and services. The tax amount is usually calculated by applying a percentage rate to the taxable price of a sale.\n  Turnover tax (TOT): It is an indirect tax which is similar to a sales tax or VAT, with the different that (TOT) tax imposed on those who are not register for VAT which their annual taxable transaction is under the total value of 500,000 birr.\n  Withholding tax: is a government requirement for the payer of an item of income to withhold or deduct tax from the payment, and pay that tax to the government.\n  Stamp duty: is a tax that is levied on documents. This include the majority of legal documents such as cheques, receipts, marriage licenses and land transactions. A physical stamp (a tax stamp) had to be attached to or impressed upon the document to denote that stamp duty had been paid before the document was legally effective.\n  Excise duties: This tax is imposed on selected goods, such as luxury goods and basic goods which are demand-inelastic. Tax on gasoline and other fuel and tax on tobacco and alcohol.\niii Foreign trade tax: It comprises both import and export taxes.\n  Import tax: An import tax collected on imported goods. Such as a tariff is a tax levied on imports or exports.\n  Export tax: An export tax is a tax collected on exported goods.\niv Non-tax source of government revenue: are government revenue not generated from taxes. Examples include:\n  charges and fees\n  sales of government goods and service\n  government investment income\n  privatization proceeds\nB External Assistance\nIt comprises of grants, loans and technical assistance from bilateral or multilateral agencies.\nC Capital revenue:\nDomestic source collection of loans and sales of government asset.",

The deficit was financed by domestic and foreign loans. In the next few years, expenditure management is expected to remain prudent, with cuts in recurrent expenditure and priority given to key social sectors such as health, education, agriculture, as well as support for infrastructure development.\nIn the past years, fiscal deficit has shown a declining trend with a \u20137.2 percent of GDP in 2001/02 to \u20132.9 percent of GDP in 2007/08.\nFiscal Deficit Financing\nThere are three main ways the government can finance a deficit.\n  Firstly, the government can borrow funds from the other sources of the economy.

But this method is not advisable. It is because it is highly inflationary: when the government increases money supply, if the economy is near full employment, demand pull inflation occurs rapidly, as there is too much money chasing a limited supply of goods.",

        "chunk_text": "What do you understand about import and export taxes? And what are the reasons that government levied them?\nDecentralization\nDecentralization is a systematic delegation of authority at all levels of management and in all of the organizations. In a decentralization concern, authority retained by the top management for taking major decisions and formulating policies and the rest of the authority may be delegated to the middle and lower levels of management.\nDecentralization is not the same as delegation. In fact, decentralization is an extension of delegation. Decentralization is wider in scope and the authorities are diffused to the lowest levels of management. Delegation of authority is a complete process and takes place from one person to another, while decentralization is complete only when fullest possible delegation has taken place.\nFiscal decentralization, which involves the sharing of revenue between regions and central governments, and introduced transfers and subsidies, is part of the decentralization process.\nFiscal decentralization is intended to assist regional governments by boosting their capacity for developing their localities through self-initiative. It is also meant to narrow the existing gaps in economic growth and development among regions. Despite this, fiscal imbalances between regions and heavy dependence of the regional governments on the federal government\u2019s transfer and subsidies have persisted.\nFiscal decentralization in Ethiopia emanates from federal and regional governments\u2019 constitutions. It has the objectives of devolving fiscal decision-making power to lower governments, and narrowing the vertical fiscal gap as well as ensuring horizontal equalization. Accordingly, the regional governments are empowered to the extent of levying taxes, and preparing and administering their own budgets. They are also entitled to collect their defined revenues, draw budget subsidies from the federal government and borrow from domestic sources.\nAs the devolution process was initiated prior to the adoption of the constitution, the transitional government issued Proclamation 33/92 which defined the nature of fiscal relations between the federal and regional governments.\nThe proclamation has had the objectives of enabling both levels of governments to carry out their respective duties and responsibilities effectively, assist regional governments to develop their regions on their own initiatives, narrow the gap in development and economic growth between regions and encourage their common interest.\nMoreover, Proclamation 7/92 which affirmed the rights of Federal and Regional Governments and the Constitution of the Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia ratified powers and responsibilities of all levels of governments.\nThe major driving factor for assigning expenditure responsibilities and decision-making powers to the lower level governments is to improve their ability of efficiently identifying and addressing their citizens\u2019 needs. Being closer to the beneficiary population, sub-national levels of governments have informational advantage over the federal government as they can better see their constituents\u2019 needs. In line with these assumptions, regional governments have greater incentive to improve service delivery on the one hand, and on the other, beneficiaries and citizens can easily monitor their actions and evaluate them constantly and timely.\nIn Ethiopia, the federal government\u2019s powers and functions are more clearly defined in the constitution and generally encompass all national public goods such as:\n  defence,\n  foreign policy,\n  fiscal and money policy,\n  designing of economic and social policies, and,\n  building major infrastructure such as those of air, railway, shipping, postal, telecommunication and electric power.\nRegional governments, therefore, are responsible for duties related to basic service delivery, such as primary and secondary education, health, water and sanitation, rural roads, agriculture and natural resources.\nIt is apparent that regional and wereda administrations (the lowest level of administration) have significant responsibility for the provision of basic services targeted to reduce poverty, by way of generating income and empowering the local people.\nThe economic system in the Military Government was characterized by a high degree of centralization the decision-making and responsibility, and economic power was concentrated in the hands of few government officials. The new government, on the other hand, is based on the principle of decentralization.\nWe have now federal and regional governments and each of them have their own duties and responsibilities. Regional states exercise their power over their jurisdictions by using their own plans and budgets. This way of administration gives economic freedom to properly manage and efficiently use resources at the disposal of the regional state. And there are other measures taken by the government sine 1992/93, such as,\n  rationalization of tax structure;\n  broadening of tax base;\n  reduction of government expenditure by narrowing public sector, selling loss-making public enterprises to generate revenue from the sale as well as to reduce expenditure; and\n  reduction of the marginal tax rate. A marginal tax rate is the tax rate that applies to the last dollar of the tax base (taxable income or spending).",

        "chunk_text": "Before the invention of money, trade was based on the barter system. It is a system of transaction where goods and services are directly exchanged with goods and services. The barter system had many pitfalls. Among others, the need for double coincidence of wants was the prominent problem of barter system. People have to find someone who has a good or service they want and who also wants the good or service they have to offer. Money is anything that people are willing to accept in payment for goods and services or to pay off debt. Some form of rudimentary financial activities and exchange with the help of money in Ethiopia is dated back to the Axumite kingdom. Coins were mainly minted to facilitate external trade transactions. Usually, these coins were made of precious metals such as gold, silver, and bronze. Iron and salt bars were used to conduct domestic trade transaction. Later on, due to the fact that the intrinsic value of some precious metals and coins was greater than their face value, and hence used for making ornaments and other purposes, exchanges of goods and services were replaced by commodity money. In addition to the intrinsic value, the downfall of the Axumite kingdom eliminated the circulation of coins, and trade was conducted by the traditional form of exchange, using commodities that served as medium of exchange. This is what is known as the stage of commodity money. Commodities such as bars of salt, pieces of cloth, bars of iron and different types of shells were used as a medium of exchange. Other currencies that were issued and circulated in and around Harar city after the Axumite coins were the \u201cMahalek\u201d and the \u201cAshrafi\u201d that existed from 1789-1887. These were hand-made currencies for local use by the habitats of Harar. Later the entire region used \u201cAmole Chew\u201d (Salt Bar) for many years. In the nineteenth century and early twentieth century, Austrian thaler (the Maria Theresa dollar) served as a medium of exchange together with the use of Amole. The thaler was first minted in Vienna, the capital city of Austria in 1741 and named after the Empress Maria Theresa of Austria. It had a silver purity of 800 karats, which means it contained 80% of pure silver. Hence, after a long time the country was back to metallic money. Thaler was a widely acceptable means of exchange until it was replaced by the national currency in 1945. During the Italian short occupation (1935 \u2013 1941) there were about 50 million Marie Theresa thalers circulating in the economy. In 1894 coins bearing the image of Emperor Menelik II appeared, these were. Made of silver and copper, the first national currencies after the fall of the Axumite kingdom. In 1908, \u201cBirr\u201d, containing the image of Emperor Menelik II, was declared as a medium of exchange and a legal tender throughout Ethiopia by proclamation. These notes and coins served for a long time until the fall of the Imperial regime in 1974. The Millitary regime (Derg) introduced a new legal tender in 1976 with the same denomination without the twenty and five hundred Birr. In 1998 the new government (EPRDF) slightly changed the currency notes but not the coins, using the same denominations as they were also circulating in Eriteria after independence in 1991. Paper currency decreed by governments as legal tender (meaning that legally it must be accepted as payment for debts) but not convertible into coins or precious metal is known as Fiat Money.",

Following this, in 1943, the Ethiopian government established the State Bank of Ethiopia. The establishment of this bank by Ethiopia was a painful process because Britain was against it. The Bank of Ethiopia operated as both a commercial and a central bank until 1963 when it was split and remodelled into today\u2019s National Bank of Ethiopia (re-established the Central Bank, as in 1976) and the Commercial Bank of Ethiopia (CBE). After this period, many other banks were established during Emperor Haile Sellasie I\u2019s regime. Just before the 1974 revolution, the banks listed in Table 7.2 were in operation. All privately owned financial institutions, including three commercial banks, thirteen insurance companies, and two non-bank financial intermediaries, were nationalized on 1 January 1975 under the Derg regime. The nationalized banks were reorganized into one commercial bank (namely, the Commercial Bank of Ethiopia), two specialized banks \u2013 the Agricultural and Industrial Development Bank (AIDB), and Housing and Saving Bank (HSB), and one insurance company. Following the regime change in 1991 and the liberalization policy in 1992, these financial institutions were reorganized to work in a market-oriented-policy framework. The CBE, EIC and NBE have retained their names and functions, whereas the AIDB was renamed as Development Bank of Ethiopia (DBE), and the HSB was renamed as Construction and Business Bank (CBB). Currently the major financial institutions operating in Ethiopia are banks, insurance companies and micro-finance institutions. A number of commercial banks and insurance companies have also been established in the reform period. In 2008/09, the number of commercial banks operating in the country reached 13, of which ten were private commercial banks, and the remaining three were state owned. In 2008/09, with the launching of new insurance companies, namely Ethio-Life and Oromia Insurance Company, the number of insurance companies in the country expanded to 12. In terms of ownership, all insurance companies, except the Ethiopian Insurance Corporation (EIC), are privately owned.",

        "chunk_text": "Roles and Functions of the National Bank of Ethiopia Among the most important players in financial markets throughout the world are national banks, which are the government authorities in charge of monetary policies. National banks\u2019 actions affect interest rates, the amount of credit available, and the money supply, all of which have direct impacts not only on financial markets, but also on aggregate output and inflation. A national bank is a financial institution established to act on behalf of the government to control and regulate activities of the financial sector. It has different names in different countries. It is usually referred to as Central Bank, which is the apex of the banking sector. For instance, in Kenya it is \u201cCentral Bank of Kenya\u201d, in the U.S.A., \u201cThe Federal Reserve Bank.\u201d, in the U.K, \u201cThe Bank of England\u201d Unlike commercial banks, the objective of national banks is not generating profit by transacting with the general public in depositing, borrowing, and lending activities. The duties and responsibilities of national banks are far more extensive than those of commercial banks or of any other financial institutions. The National Bank of Ethiopia (NBE) was established with capital of Birr ten million. It was owned and operated by the government and managed by a board of directors. The NBE was restructured by the government with Proclamation No 206/1963 and began its operation in 1964. After the fall of Emperor Haile Sellasie I, it was restructured by Proclamation No 99/1976. The roles and functions of the NBE were redefined again after the downfall of the Derg in Proclamation No 83-84/1994. The bank has now, among other things, the following responsibilities. It has the exclusive right to mint coins and print (issue) currency notes that circulate in the national economy; issues government debt instruments or securities such as bonds, treasury bills, and promissory notes on behalf of the government; promotes the existence of balanced and accelerated economic growth; reduces the level of unemployment and maintains low levels of inflation; encourages the formation of micro and other financial institutions and supervises and regulates the activities and operations of these financial institutions in general and of commercial banks in particular; acts as the banker of the government: deposits government money and provides direct advances to the government; acts as a last resort for commercial banks that need to borrow money at times of shortage; regulates the money supply, interest rates and other charges, and the creation of credit by commercial banks; formulates the monetary policy framework for the country; manages and administers the international reserve of the country; regulates the foreign exchange of the country and organizes the foreign exchange auction market for the determination of the exchange rates; and prepares regular reports on the money supply, production of goods and services, and official international economic transactions carried out by the country. Roles and Functions of Commercial Banks and Insurance Companies A The Commercial Bank of Ethiopia (CBE) The Commercial Bank of Ethiopia is the biggest and the leading commercial bank in Ethiopia. It had 32.9 % of the banking sector in Ethiopia in 2008/09. It had 209 branches throughout the country and 5 billion Birr capital in the same year. It was incorporated as a share company in December as per the Monetary and Banking Proclamation No 207/1995. It took over the banking activities of the former State Bank of Ethiopia and began operation in January 1964. The initial capital of the bank was Birr 20 million. The first private bank that was in operation together with the Commercial Bank of Ethiopia was Addis Bank S.C. It was established in October 1964 as a joint venture (JV) between Ethiopians and National and Grindlays Banks of London. The bank was established with a paid up capital of 2 million Birr. Its capital increased to 5 million Birr by the year 1968 with a total of 26 branches and 300 employees. By 1976, Addis Bank was merged with other banks, of Italian origin, under Proclamation No 69/1975. The capital had increased to 20 miilion Birr, and there were 34 branches and 480 employees, making it the second largest commercial bank in the country. Due to the change of regime and the Derg economic policy, the Addis Bank and the former Commercial Bank of Ethiopia were merged to form the present day Commercial Bank of Ethiopia on August 2, 1980. In the same year, the bank had 65 million Birr capital and 155 branches throughout the country. Roles and functions of CBE: Help to encourage households to save money, since saving is important for investment; Accept Deposits of different kinds, such as saving, time, and demand deposit; Advance loans, credit, overdrafts, and other services for individuals and firms; Conduct supervision and follow-up on the use of credit and loans provided to customers; Maintain safe-deposit vaults and lockers and receive valuables and securities for safe custody; Sell and purchase foreign currencies; Issue letters of credit (LC), travellers cheques, etc; Issue bonds and participate in the buying and selling of treasury bills, bonds, and other negotiable instruments and securities; Conduct the transfer of money from one place to another; Prepare regular financial reports to the NBE; Accelerate the process of monetization in the economy. Broadly speaking, the following are the major types of bank, classified based on their functions: Commercial Banks: advance short-term funds/loans to business people and traders. Their deposits are only for a short period. The loan period extends from 3 to 6 months. Industrial Banks: provide long-term loans to industries Agricultural Banks: meet the requirements of the agricultural community, particularly in a predominantly agricultural country. Foreign Exchange Banks: specialize in facilitating foreign trade by making international payments. B Development Bank of Ethiopia (DBE) One of the two specialized banks established in the 1940s, during the Imperial region, was the Agricultural Bank. It was initially established in 1945, and it was replaced by the Development Bank of Ethiopia in 1951. The purpose of the bank was to foster the development of the agricultural sector. On the other hand, the Investment Bank of Ethiopia (IBE) was established in 1963 for the purpose of developing the industrial sector. The Agricultural and Industrial Development Bank (AID Bank) was established in 1974 with the paid up capital of 100,000 Birr by the government to take over the activities of the former DBE and IBE. The objectives, functions, and roles of the AID bank include the following: To advance loans and credit for the development of both the agricultural and industrial sectors; To act as agent or representative of individuals and firms to effect payment on their behalf; To act as a guarantor to viable agricultural and industrial projects; To supervise and control the activities of projects financed by the bank; To engage in investment of equities; and To perform other similar functions and responsibilities like the commercial banks. C The Construction and Business Bank (CBB) The other specialized bank was the Housing and Saving Bank (HSB) which was established in November 1975. The bank was created by amalgamating the former Imperial Saving and Home Ownership Public Association and the Saving and Mortgage Corporation S.C. The purpose of the bank was to encourage the construction of residential houses by providing long-term loans at a low rate of interest in urban areas. The working capital of the bank in 2008/09 was 196 million Birr. It had 32 branches by the same year. The objectives, functions and roles of the bank are, among other: Provision of long-term loans and credits in the construction and acquisition of buildings; Accepting saving, demand, and time deposit so as to mobilise funds for investment in construction; Conducting, monitoring and following up end uses of loans advanced; Discounting promissory notes and other securities issued by other parties; and Performing similar other functions as commercial banks as per the Commercial Code of Ethiopia. D Insurance Services in Ethiopia Every day we face the possibility of the occurrence of certain problems leading to uncertainities that could lead to large financial losses. A spouse\u2019s earnings might disappear due to death or illness; a car accident might result in costly repair bills or payments to an injured party. Because financial losses from crises could be large relative to our financial resources, we protect ourselves against them by purchasing insurance coverage that will pay a sum of money if the uncertainty occurs. Life insurance companies sell policies that provide income if a person dies, is incapacitated by illness, or retires. History tells us that insurance services in Ethiopia have been known since the Axumite era. However, the collapse of the Axumite kingdom led to the formation of local and indigenous self-help groups, such as \u201cIdir\u201d, \u201cEkub\u201d, and \u201cMahiber\u201d. These informal institutions are serving the peoples of Ethiopia up to now. Modern forms of insurance service are said to have been introduced in Ethiopia by Europeans. The practice of modern insurance services started in the 1920s when the Bank of Abyssinia started underwriting fire and marine insurance as an agency to a foreign bank. The first insurance company was established in 1923 by an Austrian named Muzinger, which served as an agency for a foreign Fire Insurance Company. During the Italian invasion, no insurance company was allowed to operate except the Italian insurance companies. The nationalization of foreign and local private insurance companies in 1975 led to the formation and establishment of the Ethiopian Insurance Corporation (EIC) in January 1976 by Proclaimation No. 68/1975 with a paid capital of 11 million Birr with the aim of providing all kinds of insurance services in Ethiopia. In 2008/09, EIC had 39 branches and 249.4 million Birr capital.",

        "chunk_text": "The pre-reform period here refers to the Derg period from 1974 to 1991. This was a regime characterized by absolute government control of major economic activities in the country. During this period all private banks were nationalized and converted into institutions organized along socialist principles. It was the duty of the National Bank of Ethiopia to regulate the activities of these institutions on behalf of the government. As noted earlier, CBE, AIDB (DBE), HSB (CBB) were in operation during this period. In addition to these banks, there were also two other financial institutions: Ethiopian Insurance Corporation (EIC) and the Pension and Social Security Authority (PSSA). The government also attempted to offset its budget deficit by borrowing from the banking system which constrains the amount of money that goes to the private sector; this reduced the participation of the private sector. For instance, the interest on saving deposits made by the private sector remained at 6% on deposits up to 100,000 Birr and 2% over this amount so as to discourage \u201caccumulation of capital\u201d. In fact, saving deposits by socialized sectors were not allowed. Interest rates on time deposits were between a minimum of 4% to 7.5%, depending on the sources of the funds. Lending rates were also discriminatory in nature. Cooperatives were the most favoured customers of banks, followed by public enterprises. The lending rates remained between 9% and 10.5% for most of the activities in the different sectors of the economy: 8.5% for export trade, 3-5% to the central government, and 5-6.5% for banks until June 1986. These rates were revised on July 1, 1986, becoming slightly higher for public enterprises, and were further raised for the private sectors. All in all, the financial policy of the Derg favored inefficient public sectors at the expense of private sectors, and it proved to be a failure for the development of the financial sector. The attempt of the government to expand the public sector was very much limited due to the shortage of foreign exchange. This in turn led to borrowing and dependency on foreign assistance. However, it was difficult to get external financial assistance due to political ideology differences, and the funds were allocated in non-development areas such as defences, and military expansion. The government kept the exchange rate at a low level by establishing a fixed exchange rate regime. Exchange rate, as price of domestic currency expressed in terms of foreign currency, affects the price of both export and import goods. The fixed exchange rate policy was adopted primarily to prevent the domestic cost of imported goods, especially that of imported raw materials and inputs. However, the overvalued exchange rate has affected the growth of the export sector by making the price of exported goods expensive at abroad. The government also adopted a very restrictive foreign exchange policy in order to reduce aggregate demand for foreign exchange in the economy. It also introduced a high import tariff. This restrictive measure, however, led to the smuggling of goods, both imported and exported, and to the flourishing of a black-market foreign exchange market. In general, huge government borrowing, restrictive financial policies, and lack of participation of private sector and inefficient use of financial resources by the public sector were the major characteristics of the Derg regime. However, relative macroeconomic stability was achieved at the expense of overall economic growth due to forced measures of saving by the good-performing public enterprises and non-bank financial institutions, and by the draining of the foreign reserve.",

Following this proclamation the country witnessed a proliferation of private banking and insurance companies. The attempt to control inflation, to maintain it at a low level was mainly carried out by adopting a monetary policy which kept the pace of growth in money supply in line with the growth rate of the nominal gross domestic product (NGDP). The government has also envisaged ensuring the availability and expansion of credit to the growing private sector and has made some adjustments to interest rates. For instance, the government abolished the discriminatory lending interest rates and fixed minimum deposit and the maximum lending rates since 1994/1995. However, the government later abolished the ceiling rates, freeing them to be determined by market forces of demand and supply in January 1998. Auctioning of securities in the open market was started in January 1994/95 with three types of TBs maturing in 28, 91, and 180 days, respectively. This marked the start of the development of the money and capital market in the country. Besides, such instruments relate to non-inflationary financing monetary policy which could help to avoid draining the amount of credit available to the private sector. The government devalued the Birr in October 1992 and introduced the auction market for foreign exchange in May 1993 in an attempt to determine the exchange rates by market forces and to increase exports. Importers, banks and investors participated in the retail market until it was replaced by the weekly wholesale foreign exchange market in 1999 that only allowed the participation of banks and investors. This was replaced by the inter-bank foreign exchange market in 2001 which allows the participation of licensed foreign exchange dealer banks to determine the daily value of a foreign currency in terms of Ethiopian Birr. In general, the EPRDF government has taken a number of policy measures to enable the financial sector to contribute to the development of the economy since 1992. Among these measures: The adoption of monetary and banking proclamation that enabled the NBE, the licensing and supervision of banking; The formation and reorganization of the two government owned specialized banks of DBE and CBB; The transferring of non-performing loans from the existing banks to the Ministry of Finance;",

The sector not only distributes the amount of credit needed but also collects back the loan advances with some margin of profit in the form of interest. Therefore, the principal and the interest is to be collected by financial institutions but this is not achieved without many difficulties. Sometimes borrowers are unable to repay their debts, and banks have large amount of non-performing loans (NPLs) and bad debts. Money, narrowly defined in the Ethiopian context, includes currency in circulation outside the banking sector and demand deposit. A demand deposit is a deposit that can be withdrawn at any time without giving prior notice. In contrast, broad money supply is defined as narrow money plus savings and time deposits. Savings and time deposits together are known as quasi money. Hence, broad money supply is the sum of narrow money supply and quasi money. Between 1972 and 1991, the narrow money supply showed an annual average growth rate of 10%. For the same period, broad money showed an annual average growth of 12.5%. However, the expansion of credit to the non-government sector has shown a declining trend. The annual growth rate of domestic liquidity per year, as measured by broad money (M2), was 21 % and reached 82.5 billion Birr compared to the 20.4% of 2007/08. The expansion in broad money was largely driven by higher net foreign assets and domestic credit. The growth in domestic credit was attributed to rises in credit to the non-government sector while credit to the government dropped by 0.9 percent. On the other hand, the rise in net foreign assets was due to higher inflows from net services, transfers, and external loans and grants. The fiscal year 2008/09 witnessed a surge in all components of broad money. Narrow money rose by 19.1 percent to Birr 42.1 billion, driven by 11.7 and 26.6 percent increases in currency in circulation and demand deposits reflecting the growing economic activities and higher transactions demand for money. Similarly, quasi money surged to 23.0%, owing to growing financial intermediation as banks continued to expand their branches throughout the country. One of the most important functions of commercial banks in the area of financial intermediation is deposit mobilization and lending activities. There has been growth in these activities in the post-reform period. Minimum interest rates on savings and time deposits remained the same for 2007/08 and 2008/09, at 4%, while the maximum deposit rate rose to 5 percent from 4.5 percent for the same period. Hence, the average interest rate on savings deposits increased to 4.5% from 4.08 percents and that of time deposits increased to 5.26 percent from 5.16 percent. Similarly, the average lending rate rose to 12.25 in 2008/09.",

        "chunk_text": "The major problem facing the financial sector in the country is under-development. This can take different forms: the economy is less and less monetized; that is, it has limited circulation of money and limited number of financial institutions throughout the country. Dealings and transactions are conducted in the traditional/ informal sector in certain parts of rural areas as well as urban areas. Hence there are different kinds of bottlenecks for the development of the formal financial sector. These include, among other things: A good part of the economy is not monetized; Some borrowers, both private and public enterprises, fail to repay back loans at the agreed time in the required amount; Banks are now forced to sell collateral to enforce repayment of debts which takes time, a long process and effort; Lack of weak competition in the sector; Maintenance of large amounts of financial resources by some banks due to high collateral requirements and lack of viable projects; Shortage of trained and efficient human resources in the sector; Inadequacy of banks to convert cash into credit; Lacklustre financial deepening in the country; Very low level innovation in financial products and services; and The availability of medium-term financing for activities such as agricultural land development, irrigation, purchase of machinery and equipment, plantation, and food processing and packing are either very limited or unavailable. However, the sector has tremendous and unexploited potential for development. The spread of small financial institutions throughout the country can help to channel surplus funds to the formal financial sector. This can be done by mobilizing large amounts of local as well as foreign savings. Efforts are also required to expand the types of financial services provided by the existing institutions. A strong policy framework and a strengthened regulatory government body is required to avoid unfair practices in the banking and insurance services.",

        "chunk_text": "What is your understanding of the new economic reform taken by the current government? In 1974/75 Ethiopia made a transition from a mixed economic system to a totally controlled economy that pushed the economy downward. During the central planned economy, the restrictions and taxation on the Ethiopian economy were substantial. For instance, farmers in the main cereal growing areas had to supply a predetermined quota of grain to the government at a fixed low price and taxation levies on both rural and urban households were substantial factors of production. Also other markets were restricted, and rural wages and other market factors were repressed, and private sector developments were totally discouraged. It has been documented that the per-capita income was birr 211.17 in 1973/74 and that it declined to 180.3 in 1990/91. In the mid 1980s, famine and war not only created a huge humanitarian disaster, but also pushed the economy farther back. In terms of growth rate, the average GDP growth rate was less than two percent (2%) in the period 1973/74-1990/91. Population, on the other hand, grew at about 2.9% in the same period, causing a deterioration in the living standard of the society at large. Military expenditures absorbed about 12-16 percent of the GDP, while the fiscal deficit increased from 11.9 percent in 1987/88 to 13.2% in 1990/91. The poverty situation in the country was among the worst in the world. It has been documented that about 50% of the population in the country cannot afford the minimum food requirement. For instance, 52% of the rural and 36% of the urban population were unable to meet the minimum food requirement. This means that food poverty in rural areas was higher than in the urban ones. On top of this, 47% of the rural population and 33% of the urban population were found to be in absolute poverty. Furthermore, during the entire Military era, gross domestic saving was between 2.8% and 12.5% of the GDP, which was 14% of GDP in 1973/74. The public deficit became a huge burden on the economy, reaching 8.6 billion USD in 1990/91. The per-capita debt burden (356 birr) was far greater than the per-capita income of the country (18.3 birr). The reason for the problematic performance of the economy was, among other things, due to: mismanagement of economic resources, internal instability, recurrent drought, and poor performance of the agricultural sector. For instance, the annual growth rate of the agricultural sector averaged less than 2% during the Derg. Hence the agricultural sector was serously affected by the economic crisis, and it was totally incapable of protecting itself from the major economic collapse. Therefore, the performance of the Ethiopian economy progressively declined during the Derg. This major economic collapse called for substantial reforms in the country. In order to lift the economy from its low level of development that had been caused by natural and human-made catastrophes as well as rigid macroeconomic policies, the Transitional Government of Ethiopian (TGE), which came into power on 28 May 1991, took steps to rehabilitate and reconstruct the war-damaged economy by adopting market-oriented economic policies scheme and stabilization and Structural Adjustment Program (SAP).",

        "chunk_text": "In response to the near collapse of the Ethiopian economy, coupled with unsustainable internal and external imbalances like the high inflation rate, negative interest rate and unviable debt ratio, the government of Ethiopia (GOE) in 1993 initiated a Structural Adjustment Program (SAP) for the period 1993-1996 with the support of the International Monetary Fund (IMF), World Bank (WB), African Development Fund (ADF) and other multilateral and bilateral donors. The Structural Adjustment Program\u2019s refers to the reorganization of institutions, economic activities and the entire social system, in line with market-oriented economic systems. The overall goal of SAP was stabilization and adjustment. The stabilization policy focused on restoring macroeconomic balance and reducing inflation and government budget, controlling the economy and the like. The Structural Adjustment Policy focused also on removing constraints on the supply side and pay a close attention to the production of export crops through depreciation of the real exchange rate and other incentives. The Structural Adjustment Polices were also aimed at encouraging the development of the private sector, fostering competition throughout the economy and promoting the process of market determination of all prices, including exchange rates and interest rates. The main objectives of SAP include revival of economic growth, reducing macroeconomic distortion, improving economic efficiency and resource allocation and expanding the productive capacity of the economy. Broadly speaking, the structural adjustment program has three components Expenditure reducing policy Expenditure switching policy Institutional policy reform A Expenditure reducing policys: it is a policy of reducing spending level in the economy by adopting stringent monetary policies such as tight money supply, credit control and reducing public deficit. The aim of this policy is to curtail domestic demand so that demand-pull inflation can be prevented and domestic saving can be promoted. B Expenditure switching policy: it is a policy of redirecting productive resources from nonproductive sectors to productive sectors or investments. Such a policy incorporates exchange rate devaluation, trade intervention, taxes, tariffs, and deregulation of price. C Institutional policy reform: it is a policy of restructuring institutions towards competitiveness and efficiency through a market-oriented economy. The policy reform includes trade liberalization, privatization, reducing the state holdings in the economy, fiscal reform, financial market reform, and the like.",

        "chunk_text": "Ethiopia responded to the problem discussed in 8.1 by undertaking appropriate policy measures aimed at correcting imbalances in the economy, promoting the role of market forces in allocating resources, and removing impediments to the development of the private sector. The main policy measures for achieving the country\u2019s development objectives were: 1 Macroeconomic reforms include: Monetary policy Exchange rate policy Fiscal policy and Interest rate policy A Monetary policy: the government of Ethiopia pursues a tight monetary policy to ensure consistency in money expansion with low inflation, rapid economic growth and external balances. B Exchange rate policy: in 1992, a devaluation scheme was adopted to encourage exports and discourage imports. This helps to narrow the gap between export and import and thereby improve current account. It also helps to narrow the gap between official and black-market rates and abolish illegal trade in the country. C Fiscal policy: is defined as the part of government economic policy which deals with taxation, expenditure, borrowing and the management of public debt in the economy. Such policy reform is undertaken to reduce fiscal deficit by greatly reducing government expenditure and expanding the tax base. At a time of depression and unemployment, the government should spend more than its revenue and thus insure a deficit in the budget. D Interest rate policy: interest rate ceilings were abolished so as to enable it to reflect the state of the finical sector. 2 Privatization: with the objective of economic efficiency and profitability, a number of public enterprises have been privatized, and the process of privatization is still underway. 3 Transport deregulation: zonal restriction on transport service was abolished. To improve the financial performance of the sector, transport tariff rates have been revised. 4 Domestic price liberalization: price controls were abolished; prices of state-owned industrials and agricultural products were left to be determined by the market force of demand and supply. 5 Foreign trade liberalization: restrictions on trade were lifted by introducing a system of open general license. Export taxes on all commodities, except on coffee, were removed. Trade liberalization reacquird removal of import barriers inclining the replacement of quantitative restriction (quota) by tariffs whose rates are to be revised over time. Accordingly tariff rates have been revised and reduced. 6 Private sector reform: this measure is undertaken to encourage the participation of the private sector in the economic growth and development endeavors of the country. As a result the investment policy was revised in such a way as to promote both domestic and foreign investments and also to expand production activities and employment in the country. Absorption of foreign technology know-how and technical skills by Ethiopian entrepreneurs were also parts of the investment objective.",

        "topic": "8.2 PERFORMANCE OF THE ECONOMY AFTER THE NEW ECONOMIC REFORM PROGRAM",
        "chunk_text": "What is your opinion about the new economic reform program taken by the government? The trend of economic growth for the period between 1960 and 1992 was unsatisfactory. This very dismal economic performance was caused by a number of factors, including rigid macroeconomic policies, protracted war, and recurrent droughts, which drained huge amounts of the country\u2019s resources and created a hostile external environment. The problem of the drought was the most severe of all. It has been documented that the extent of drought varies from period to period, and that, between 1960 and 1992, drought and famine occurred at least nine times. The size and magnitude of rainfall has substantial effect on the performance of the entire economy, and so the above-mentioned drought conditions shrank the economy significantly. Between 1963/64-1998/99, regardless of the policy regime, real GDP grew, on average, by 2.97%, while population grew, average, by 2.9%, resulting in a 0.06% (2.97%-2.91% = 0.06) annual growth rate per-capita income. This indicates that the economy had stagnated for the last three decades or so. From Table 8.1 you can see that the public sector deficit declined between 1989/90 and 1998/99, except in 1993/94 and 1998/99. In the latter years there was the Ethio-Eriteria war, which resulted in the highest recurrent expenditure. Thus, in the area of public deficit reduction, it can be concluded that the program was a success. From Table 8.2, notice that the average growth rate of agriculture decreased, the industry sector showed improvement, and the service sector increased rapidly in 1996/97 - 1998/99. From Table 8.3, notice that the period of the reform program showed an improvement in all indicators except in GDS. A higher share in gross capital formation (GCF) was achieved due to the creation of an enabling environment, especially for the development of the private sector, and to the mobilization of available resources. As shown in Table 8.4, all those measures aimed at developing the private sector bore fruit. The number of approved investment projects has risen rapidly even since the implementation of the program. A total of 50/50 projects were approved between 1992/93 and 1998/99 for a total amount of 41.5 billion birr, of which 1491 have actually commenced operation for a total amount of 8.8 billion birr. This trend is expected to accelerate as the privatization program moves into full capacity.",

        "chunk_text": "What is your understanding of the investment policy taken by the current government? It is widely known that the ancient country of Ethiopia underwent a period of turmoil, economic stagnation and famine during the 1970s and 1980s. In 1991, the Military government was replaced by the Transitional Government of Ethiopia with the introduction of new political and economic policies. In terms of the economic reform policy, a new program was launched with one of its primary objective being to build an economy in which the private sector plays a leading role. To enhance the role of private investment in the development process, various policy measures have been taken by the government. The policy measures were designed to eliminate discrimination against the private sector and to create a conducive environment for private investment. Investment Proclamation No. 15/1992 was issued as the first policy measure by the Transitional Government of Ethiopia (TGE) for the purpose of encouraging both domestic and foreign investment. This proclamation removed restrictions on private investment and allowed for wide participation of the private sector. Several investment incentives were provided under Article 13 of the proclamation. The proclamation states that domestic and foreign investors shall be entitled to exemption of import and export related taxes and duties, income tax withholding and some other benefits. Further more the proclamation listed available investment opportunities in the country. The investment areas that are reserved only for government are: Defence Heavy industry Large-scale electrical and energy work Large-scale air and marine transportation Postal and telecommunication servicese. The minimum investment capital requirement for the private investors in the country was also indicated. In the proclamation foreign investors were required to have a minimum investment capital of $USD 500,000 and deposit in cash of not less than 25% of the investment capital. With regard to domestic investors, they were required to have a minimum capital of Ethiopian birr 250,000. However, it is stated that these minimum investment capital requirements could be lowered in areas of special interest such as technology and know-how. Later, Proclamation No 15/1992 was revised as Proclamation No. 37/1996. The new proclamation solved the shortcomings of Proclamation No. 15/1992, by reducing the minimum capital requirement for foreign investors from the previous $USD 500,000 to as low as $USD 100,000 and by lifting off 25% of the cash deposit. The new investment Proclamation No. 280/2002 amended by Proclamation No 375/2003 was enacted with a view to: Encouraging and promoting the private sector in the economic development of the country. Widening the scope of participation of foreign investment. Creating a transparent and efficient system of investment administration; this investment proclamation provides that a foreign investor can investment either As a sole proprietor with full equity ownership or Jointly or in partnership with domestic investor(s) or the government The law also stipulates the following capital requirement: A minimum capital of $USD 100,000 for a single investment project in cash and /or in kind for wholly foreign owned inventors. A minimum capital of $USD 50,000 in cash and /or in kind per project in areas of engineering, architecture, accounting and audit service projects or business management consultancy services.",
