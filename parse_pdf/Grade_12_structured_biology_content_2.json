These groups are:\n\u2022 protozoa \u2022 some fungi\n\u2022 some algae \u2022 viruses\n\u2022 bacteria\nProtozoa, fungi and algae\nProtozoa are unicellular organisms that lack a cell wall. Most of\nthem are motile (able to move), and include organisms such as\nAmoeba, Plasmodium (the organism that causes malaria), and\nParamecium.\nThe only unicellular fungi are the yeasts. These include brewer\u2019s\nyeast and baker\u2019s yeast (Saccharomyces) as well as the yeast-like\norganism that causes thrush in humans (Candida).\nAlthough the yeasts are the only unicellular fungi, other fungi are\nalso classed as micro-organisms. Many fungi produce a mycelium\nof microscopic strands called hyphae. They release enzymes from\nthese strands that digest whatever the fungus is growing on. The\nproducts of digestion are then absorbed into the fungus to help with\nits growth and reproduction. Remember, fungi do not have true\nroots, stems and leaves. Some fungi live on or in living organisms,\nas parasites. Others live on dead material as saprobionts, organisms\nthat digest their food externally and absorb the products.\nAlgae are an important group of organisms. Many are large\n(the seaweeds are all algae), but some algae are unicellular.\nThe unicellular algae are part of the plankton, the\ncollections of small microscopic plant and animal organisms that\nfloat or drift in large numbers in fresh or salt water, providing food\nfor fish and other larger organisms. These unicellular algae in the\noceans produce far more oxygen during photosynthesis than all the\nforests in the world together.\nSome unicellular algae are motile \u2013 they can move.\nViruses are sometimes referred to as micro-organisms, although\nsome biologists say that, strictly, they are not organisms at all.\nViruses cannot independently carry out any of the processes\ncommon to all living organisms. They can only reproduce inside\nother cells. So they are all parasites. Some parasitise bacteria, some\nparasitise plants and others parasitise animals. The basic virus is not\neven a cell \u2013 it has no nucleus and no cytoplasm \u2013 but it does have\ngenetic material surrounded by a protein coat."

Bacteria, however, have prokaryotic cells. In prokaryotic cells there is no true nucleus separated from the rest of the cell by a membrane. Instead, the DNA of the bacterium forms a continuous loop that is intermingled with the cytoplasm. Not all bacteria have all the structures shown in the diagram. For example, not all bacteria have a capsule and many do not have a flagellum. All bacteria do have a cell wall (but it is not made from cellulose like plant cell walls and instead is made from a substance called peptidoglycan, which makes it rigid), a cell membrane, cytoplasm, ribosomes and DNA. Although bacterial cells vary a great deal in size, they are usually much smaller than eukaryotic cells. Bacterial cells are usually between 1 and 10 \u00b5m long, whereas eukaryotic cells are between 10 and 100 \u00b5m long. (1 \u00b5m is 0.001 mm, one-thousandth of one millimetre.)",

The difference is due to the structure of the cell wall of the different bacteria. Gram-negative bacteria have much less peptidoglycan in their cell walls. This is the part of the wall that absorbs the stain. They also have a membrane outside the peptidoglycan cell wall, which Gram-positive bacteria do not have. This outer membrane secretes endotoxins (a type of toxin that is a structural component of these bacteria) and is also quite resistant to many antibiotics. This makes diseases caused by Gram-negative bacteria more difficult to treat. Gram-negative bacteria, on the whole, cause more serious diseases, although there are exceptions \u2013 the bacterium that causes tuberculosis is a Gram-positive bacterium. Gram staining is used much less than it was in diagnosing disease, as more advanced and more reliable biochemical techniques have become available.",

These groups are:\n\u2022 DNA viruses \u2013 for example, Herpes simplex (causes cold sores)\n\u2022 RNA viruses \u2013 for example, H1N1 virus (causes swine flu)\n\u2022 retroviruses \u2013 for example, HIV (causes AIDS)\nDNA viruses\nWhen a DNA virus infects a cell, the viral DNA can replicate itself and can also control the synthesis of virus proteins, so that the new DNA and new protein can be assembled into new virus particles.\nRNA viruses\nWhen an RNA virus infects a cell, its RNA can be used to synthesise more viral proteins, including an enzyme that controls the synthesis of more RNA. The new RNA and new proteins can be assembled into new virus particles. With the exception of the RNA viruses, all organisms store their permanent information in DNA, using RNA only as a temporary messenger for information. DNA is quite a stable molecule, is not very reactive with other molecules, and replicates very accurately. In contrast, RNA is quite unstable and makes frequent mistakes during copying. But these very properties make RNA ideal for the storage of viral information. Once the host\u2019s immune system has learned to recognise an infecting virus and create antibodies against it, it can quickly destroy it, and the virus needs to change its nature so that the host\u2019s immune system will no longer recognise it \u2013 it must mutate. The unstable nature of RNA allows RNA viruses to evolve far more rapidly than DNA viruses, frequently changing their surface structure.\nRetroviruses\nRetroviruses also contain RNA, but replicate in a different way. When they infect cells, they release into the cells their RNA and an enzyme that causes it to be \u2018reverse-transcribed\u2019 into DNA. This then controls the formation of more viral protein and RNA that can be assembled into new virus particles.\nViruses can also be classified by the type of organism they infect:\n\u2022 animal-infecting viruses\n\u2022 plant-infecting viruses\n\u2022 bacteria-infecting viruses \u2013 these are called bacteriophages\nBacteriophages have a really unusual shape \u2013 they look rather like a lunar landing module!",

Sometimes, instead of causing the cell to burst and release the viruses all at once, a few at a time are released by exocytosis through the plasma membrane. This type of life cycle is called a chronic release cycle, because release of new viruses is ongoing (chronic). In other cycles, the virus\u2019s DNA becomes incorporated into the DNA of the host cell. Each time the cell divides, the DNA is replicated, and each daughter cell gets a copy of the cell\u2019s DNA, which now includes the virus DNA. This can continue for many generations until some factor in the environment triggers the virus DNA to start producing virus proteins.

        "chunk_text": "We have studied the flow of energy through ecosystems and seen how energy is continually lost as heat from the ecosystem and has to be replaced as light. Nutrients, however, are recycled. There is a finite amount of each nutrient in an ecosystem and so the same atoms must constantly be re-used, over and over again. This happens at the ecosystem level and also globally. Ecosystems look unchanging, but they are in fact always changing. Materials are always being \u2018moved around\u2019 within an ecosystem. Nutrients are always being taken in by organisms and materials are lost when they breathe and excrete. What is a waste product to one organism becomes a vital nutrient to another. All the organisms in the ecosystem are interdependent and interact with their physical environment. Materials are moved around an ecosystem when organisms: \u2022 feed \u2022 excrete \u2022 respire and breathe \u2022 die and are decomposed The molecules that are moved around, particularly the organic molecules, store large amounts of energy in the bonds holding the atoms together. So, as materials are moved, energy is transferred also. But, as noted earlier, energy is eventually lost from the ecosystem as heat and must be replaced as light. The nutrients just keep on recycling \u2026 As you can see from Figure 2.3, decomposers (bacteria and fungi) are key in returning nutrients to the ecosystem. Important mineral elements such as nitrogen and phosphorus are returned to plants as a result of the action of decomposers. Decomposers feed by a method known as saprobiotic nutrition. They feed on dead matter \u2013 and so do you. You digest the parts of dead animals and plants that you eat and so must the decomposers. To do this, they secrete enzymes onto the dead matter. The enzymes digest the complex organic molecules into simpler, smaller ones and the micro-organisms absorb these products of digestion (just like you). But, unlike you, their extracellular digestion does not take place in a gut, it takes place in the soil, or wherever the dead matter happens to be. However, besides hydrolytic enzymes that break down complex organic molecules many micro-organisms have enzymes for other purposes. For example, many of the decomposers have an enzyme <AW 2.2.2> that releases the amino group from amino acids and converts it to ammonia. This is known as ammonification and is important in the nitrogen cycle. But that is not why it takes place. Ammonification is carried out by a range of bacteria and fungi as a way of obtaining energy from organic, nitrogen-containing compounds. The ammonia, vital to the nitrogen cycle, is just a useless by-product to these micro-organisms. This is typical of many of the chemical reactions that take place in all the nutrient cycles. The reactions are primarily energy-releasing reactions for a particular type of micro-organism. It is a \u2018happy chance\u2019 that the reactions produce a by-product that can be processed in the next stage of the nutrient cycle.",

But besides this, two other processes, denitrification and nitrogen fixation, decrease or increase, respectively, the amount of nitrogen in circulation. Denitrifying bacteria reduce nitrate to nitrogen gas that escapes from the soil. This decreases the total amount of nitrogen available to the plants, and, therefore, to all the other organisms also. Nitrogen-fixing bacteria \u2018fix\u2019 nitrogen gas into ammonium ions. This happens in two main situations: \u2022 Nitrogen-fixing bacteria free in the soil (belonging to the genera Azotobacter and Klebsiella) reduce nitrogen gas into ammonium ions in the soil. These ammonium ions can be oxidised immediately into nitrates by nitrifying bacteria, adding to the amount of nitrogen available to the plants and, therefore, the other organisms also. \u2022 Nitrogen-fixing bacteria in nodules on the roots of legumes (belonging to the genus Rhizobium) form ammonium ions that are passed to the legumes and used by them to synthesise amino acids.

However, if only one or two individuals of a particular species are present in an ecosystem, they won\u2019t be contributing a great deal to the biodiversity of the ecosystem. A more useful concept is species diversity. This takes into account, not just how many different species are present, but the success of each species in the ecosystem. An index of diversity can be calculated and this can be used to give a picture of the ecosystem as a whole. Look at the examples in table 2.3 below. They are, of course, made up, but the figures serve to illustrate a point. Each area contains the same six species and the same total number of organisms (100) yet the areas are clearly very different.

        "chunk_text": "Where have all the trees gone? Gone for timber every one. Well, not quite; some have gone to be pulped to make the paper for biology textbooks, or simply to make room for ever more humans. Deforestation is usually carried out for one of two main reasons: \u2022 to clear land for human activities, such as mining, agriculture or house building, or \u2022 to obtain timber to make products such as paper, charcoal, furniture, or to use as a building material. Tropical rainforest is one of the most complex and species-rich ecosystems in the world. Rainforest covers about 7% of the Earth\u2019s surface and contains 25% of the known species. Although many of the trees are very tall, the root systems are shallow and trees can easily fall. The shallow root systems grow in shallow, nutrient-poor soils. The soils are nutrient poor because many of the minerals from the soil remain \u2018locked up\u2019 in the huge trees. The only recycling of nutrients that occurs on a regular basis takes place when leaves fall. There is no accumulation of detritus as decomposers rapidly break down the leaves and release the mineral ions they contain. The roots take these up, leaving few mineral ions in the soil. As a result, when the forest is cleared for agriculture, crop yields are often poor after the first year and more forest must be cleared. Tropical rainforest is the most productive of natural land ecosystems. The net primary production (biomass produced allowing for losses due to respiration) is 2.2 kg m\u20132 y\u20131, nearly twice that of temperate forests. Felling tropical rainforest has far-reaching effects. \u2022 There is a serious reduction in species diversity. Many ecological niches are destroyed when trees are felled and the species that fill these niches are lost. This reduces the biodiversity of the area. \u2022 There is a reduction in the rate at which carbon dioxide is removed from the atmosphere. In addition, if the trees are burned, then carbon dioxide is added to the atmosphere. The local and global cycling of carbon is therefore affected. \u2022 There is a reduction in the amount of nitrogen returned to the soil. The nitrogen fixed in the proteins and other compounds in the massive tree trunks remains fixed in a table in London, New York or Addis Ababa. Any tree trunks not removed from the area are slow to decay and the soil is depleted in nitrate for many years. \u2022 A secondary succession will take place. If the felled area is allowed to regenerate, then seeds of many species of plant from the shrub layer will germinate. Ordinarily, the shrub layer is limited because the canopy prevents much of the light from reaching lower levels. If the shrub layer is allowed to dominate, this could give rise to a less complex ecosystem with a lower biodiversity. The felling of trees need not be totally destructive and the practice need not be halted. However, the rainforests must be conserved and felling and replanting in a planned cycle over a number of years can do this. This could give a sustainable yield of timber, without endangering the species diversity of the rainforests. One practice that has been adopted is to fell a strip of forest approximately 20 m wide and take the felled trunks to the sawmill for processing. This strip of land is not touched again for 20 years. In those 20 years, a secondary succession will have produced \u2018secondary forest\u2019 and the 20-year-old trees can be felled. For the intervening 19 years, other strips of forest are felled. Some areas are left completely untouched and act as a seed bank and core area, maintaining all ecological niches for the whole area.",

Other changes in agricultural practices have also had major effects on biodiversity. Traditionally, crops were \u2018rotated\u2019 so that in a field one year a cereal would be grown, another year perhaps a root crop such as carrots, then in another year a legume such as beans and perhaps one year \u2018fallow\u2019 (just grass, no crop).

We have just been talking about the way in which plants provide habitats and niches for animals. So the more different plants there are, the more different habitats and niches for animals (including mammals) there will be. There is one important exception. Parts of South Africa have a very high plant species richness, but do not have a correspondingly high mammal species richness. This is the Fynbos of South Africa.

Ethiopia is an important regional centre of biological diversity. The wide range in altitude and climate, the isolation of the highlands of Ethiopia, and the fact that there are so many different biomes present in the country, are some of the reasons for its high biodiversity. One estimate suggests that there are between 6500 and 6700 plant species in the country. This represents the fifth most diverse flora in Africa. About 10\u201312% of these plant species are endemic to Ethiopia (approximately 1150 plant species). And the story of plant species richness doesn\u2019t end with wild plants in Ethiopia. Ethiopia is one of the 12 centres of origin (Vavilov centres) of cultivated crops. There are 11 cultivated crops, which have their centre of genetic diversity in Ethiopia.

        "chunk_text": "Freedom of choice and action within the MA context refers to individuals having control over what happens and being able to achieve what they value. Loss of biodiversity often means a loss of choices. For example, local fishers may depend on mangroves as breeding grounds for local fish populations. Loss of mangroves therefore leads to a loss in control over the local fish stock and a livelihood they may have been pursuing for many generations and one that they value. They may be forced into something else. Another example is high-diversity agricultural systems. These systems normally produce less cash than monoculture cash crops, but farmers have some control over their entitlements because of spreading risk through diversity. The loss of biodiversity is sometimes irreversible, and the value placed on keeping biodiversity for future generations can be significant. The notion of having choices available is an essential constituent of the freedom of choice aspect of well-being. These benefits that humans gain from biodiversity are collectively known as ecosystem services. A loss of biodiversity will reduce ecosystem benefits locally and globally. In addition to reduction in the ecosystem services described above, and summarised in figure 2.27, there are other dangers that result from the loss of biodiversity. The list is huge, but here are some examples:\n\u2022 continued felling of forests in some countries leads to increased flooding\n\u2022 many medicines have been derived from plants; the oldest painkiller \u2013 aspirin \u2013 is derived from the willow tree \u2013 how many more are waiting to be discovered in plants we have not yet even named?\n\u2022 the same holds true for animals; some sheep from South America produce anti-cancer drugs \u2013 again what other aids could there be in the millions of insects yet to be discovered?\nFinally, we discussed biodiversity in the context of species diversity at the start of this section. If the number of species continues to be reduced, then this will ultimately lead to less complex ecosystems. Less complex ecosystems are less stable and more prone to \u2018collapse\u2019.

        "chunk_text": "Is there still time? Can I have any effect at all? To answer that, you must understand the cost of doing nothing. Figure 2.28 shows that, if we do nothing, and allow species extinctions to continue at the present rate, then there will be a serious reduction in biodiversity by 2050. Figure 2.28 The future of our biodiversity When you look at any particular biome, there doesn\u2019t seem to be any huge projected change, and so it is easy to believe that we can just continue to do nothing. But look at the overall trend. Our biodiversity has fallen from 90% of its potential in 1900, to 70% in 2000 and it is projected to fall to 60% by 2050 and, carrying on the projection, to 50% by 2100, with most of this biodiversity in areas such as desert and tundra that are difficult to exploit. We are losing 10% of our biodiversity every 50 years. To help visualise this, if this loss of biodiversity were concentrated in just one place, it would represent an area just larger than all of the USA. And this is assuming that things don\u2019t get any worse \u2013 just that we continue to lose our biodiversity at the same alarming rate that we are losing it now. However, there is considerable evidence to suggest that the rate of species loss (and therefore loss of biodiversity) will actually increase in the future, as figure 2.29 shows. We cannot allow this to continue. We must conserve our biodiversity for future generations and appreciate that we have a duty of care to do so. Every future generation of humans has the right to enjoy and make use of the biological resources of the planet that are available to us today. This is the core principle of conservation. Conservation does not preach that we should not make use of the biological resources available, in fact it encourages us to make use of as many as possible. However, conservation demands that we use the resources in a sustainable manner so that future generations may do the same. Action is needed at individual, local, national and international levels to achieve this. There are three guiding ideas of conservation: \u2022 research \u2013 we must know what we are doing \u2022 minimum intervention \u2013 the balances within and between ecosystems are delicate and can easily be upset, and \u2022 repair rather than replace \u2013 it is always better to try to help an ecosystem to repair any damage rather than try to replace it. The ecological principles that form the basis of conservation of biodiversity are: \u2022 any protection of species and varieties of species will support biodiversity \u2022 maintaining habitats is fundamental to conserving species \u2022 large areas usually contain more species than smaller areas with similar habitats \u2022 disturbances to habitats shape the characteristics of populations, communities and ecosystems, and \u2022 climate change will increasingly influence all types of ecosystems. The key to maintaining biodiversity will be to maintain habitats. If we can maintain habitats, the organisms will continue to visit them and live there. This will become increasingly difficult because of climate change, but, where possible, we should not allow existing habitats to become eroded and, if at all possible, should extend them. To help conserve our biodiversity, we should also use our resources in a sustainable way. This means that we must not continue to: \u2022 overfish the oceans; we must take only an agreed quota each year \u2013 but the types of fish eaten must become more diverse to provide the sheer tonnage demanded \u2022 fell rainforest in the current manner; it must be felled sustainably, by strip-felling, for example \u2022 reduce the genetic diversity of stock animals and crop plants by breeding only those that produce certain desired traits (lean meat, high milk yield, high grain yield) \u2022 grow vast areas of cereals in monoculture The above are examples only. You should try to think of other areas of our actions that need modification.",

Sometimes, different organisms can share the same habitat. However, they make different demands on that habitat. This combination of habitat and the demands made is called the ecological niche. The ecological niche of an organism describes its role within a habitat. For example, both floating plants and tadpoles are found in the open water habitat. But the plants use sunlight, carbon dioxide, water and minerals from the water, whereas the tadpoles feed on the larvae of insects. They have different ecological niches. In another example, both blue tits and great tits spend much of their time foraging in trees for insects and insect larvae. When one or the other species is present, they forage at about the same height. However, if both species are present in the same trees, they forage at different heights and so avoid competing for the same niche.",

        "chunk_text": "Intra-specific competition is the competition between members of the same species for some resource (often food) in the same habitat. In one example, gypsy moth caterpillars infested much of southern New England (on the west coast of the USA) in the summer of 1980. However, the density of this initial infestation was quite low, allowing most of the caterpillars to metamorphose into adults. The adults mated and laid masses of eggs (each mass containing several hundred eggs) on nearly every tree in the region. In the following spring, all the eggs hatched and the caterpillars began feeding. As they fed and grew, they stripped all the trees of their leaves. The millions of caterpillars were soon competing for a very limited resource \u2013 any remaining leaves! As a result, their population crashed and very few caterpillars were able to metamorphose into adults. Intra-specific competition is a major factor in controlling the populations of predators. In a typical predator\u2013prey relationship when the population of prey begins to fall, there is intra-specific competition between the predators for the remaining prey, leading to a population decline. This allows the numbers of the prey to recover. There can also be intra-specific competition between plants. In one experiment, different numbers of sunflower seeds were planted in the same sized pots. The number of live plants per pot and the mean plant height are shown in Tables 2.6A and 2.6B on the next page. With increased numbers planted, there is increased intra-specific competition between the germinating seedlings, resulting in fewer, smaller plants surviving. This has applications in agriculture with packets of seeds of crop plants being supplied with recommended sowing densities to give maximum yields.",

After an initial \u2018establishing\u2019 phase, they show what is called exponential growth, until they are limited by the environment. The difference between exponential and arithmetic growth is illustrated in table 2.7. In arithmetic growth, the numbers increase by the same fixed amount in each time period. This produces a uniform rate of growth over the time period. In exponential growth, the population doubles in each time period, producing an ever-increasing growth rate that is clearly not sustainable in nature. Figure 2.38 shows populations increasing with: \u2022 a slow rate of exponential growth (orange line) \u2022 a fast rate of exponential growth (green line) \u2022 arithmetic growth (red line) As a result of the combined influence of some or all of the biotic and abiotic factors described above, most populations develop through four main stages, illustrated in figure 2.39. The four phases are also described in table 2.8. The curve shown in figure 2.40 is an idealised curve and not many populations actually grow exactly in that manner. Figure 2.40 shows an actual population growth curve for a population of sheep over a period of 30 years. The first two phases match the \u2018idealised\u2019 curve fairly closely, but the stationary phase is anything but stationary. It fluctuates quite widely from the idealised curve. Why is this? To understand, we need to consider an idea mentioned in table 2.8 \u2013 that of \u2018carrying capacity\u2019. The carrying capacity of a population is the number that the environment is capable of supporting (or \u2018carrying\u2019) at that time. This can change from year to year. In this case, if there is a year with lots of sunshine and rain to encourage growth of grass, the sheep may well be able to obtain more food and produce more lambs than they normally would. But then the increased population would need to be supported in subsequent years. And if environmental conditions deteriorated for a few years, the population could not be sustained and would fall.",

We have come from a population of less than 5 million 10 000 years ago to a population of 6 800 000 000 (6.8 billion) at the end of 2009. The population has been increasing particularly quickly over the past two hundred years, because we have (generally) increased the quality and quantity of food available and we have decreased the impact of disease-causing organisms with improved sanitation and medical care. However, there can be no doubt that the human population has increased far too much and far too quickly. In countries with the highest population growth rates, the high growth rate is one factor in preventing or slowing development. The sheer weight of numbers makes it much more difficult to implement education programmes, health programmes, proper sanitation and all similar measures. However, looking carefully at figure 2.42 shows that the rate of population growth is slowing. This should result in the numbers levelling at around 12 billion by the year 2200. This may sound like good news, but set this alongside the fact that estimates of the carrying capacity of the Earth for humans average at around 10 billion. There will still be too many of us. The human population is subject to the same checks as other populations; the various biotic and abiotic factors still influence population size. However, the human population is subject to other factors affecting its development. These include the point at which the particular country or region develops agriculture and industrialisation. This affects growth rates, death rates and life expectancy. These changes are called the demographic transition and the stages of the demographic transition are shown in figure 2.43 overleaf. Notice that in the second and third stages of the demographic transition, death rates fall before birth rates. This creates a period when the population is increasing. In the final stages, birth rates and death rates are low and the population is stable, with either a slow increase or a slow decrease. Most developed countries are in one of these two final stages of the demographic transition, whereas developing countries are still in one of the two middle stages. As a result most of the population growth is occurring in developing countries. Rapid growth slows the transition to the later stages. In the demographic transition, the relative numbers of young and old people changes. These are best shown in age pyramids. Figure 2.44 shows age pyramids for Afghanistan (a country still developing) and the USA and Italy (developed countries). The broad base to the population in Afghanistan shows that large numbers of children are still being born and that the population is increasing. The structure in the USA is different. There are similar numbers in all the age groups until about age 60. This suggests that the numbers being born are slightly greater than those dying and the population numbers are increasing slowly. Can you explain the lack of growth in Italy? Notice also that life expectancy is greater in Italy and the USA. This is true of most developed countries. Figures 2.45A and B show the population pyramids for Ethiopia in 2000 and the projected population pyramid for 2025. Note that, although the population has increased (predicted by the structure of the population in 2000), the rate of increase is slowing.

So the mathematics is fairly simple; to reduce global population, either: \u2022 mortality will increase; this is the \u2018do-nothing option\u2019 and we can wait until the population crashes or war is rife from competition for resources because we are so far over our carrying capacity, or \u2022 natality must decrease \u2013 this is the only option we really have and one we can control; we must control the numbers of children being born if we are to stop the runaway growth of the human population. Many countries now encourage some kind of population control. A few of these are described in table 2.9. At the moment Ethiopia has one of the highest birth rates in Africa, but there are some hopeful signs that this is changing. It is progressing through the demographic transition, and, as it does so, death rates and birth rates will fall as more resources become generally available. In the meantime, it is essential that education regarding contraception is available to the people throughout Ethiopia. There are several methods of contraception available, but widespread use of condoms will have the most impact as they are the most easily available. They also give some limited protection against the transmission of HIV. Fewer children will be needed, particularly in rural communities, if more of them live longer. Good health alongside education will help to reduce the rapid increase in population growth that characterises Ethiopia at the moment. It is vital that the government makes available as many resources as possible to help local communities, particularly rural communities, with: \u2022 sex education \u2022 access to contraception \u2022 general education to enable students to consider other options in their futures All of these will help in reducing the rapid population growth rate. In addition, help with the following will improve general health, which is usually associated with lower reproduction rates: \u2022 education about diet \u2022 resources to improve the quantity and quality of crops grown and stock reared in rural communities",

        "chunk_text": "In grade 11, unit 2, we learned about biological molecules. One of these was the molecule of inheritance \u2013 DNA. We shall be learning in more detail how this molecule is able to pass on our features or traits in section 3.2. For now, however, we need to revise a little of the structure of the molecule and where it is situated in cells. Figure 3.1 shows how chromosomes, genes and DNA are related. In grade 11, unit 4, we learned that chromosomes are found in the nucleus of a cell and are made from the DNA, which is bound with histone proteins to form the chromosomes. are paternal in origin (came from our fathers) and 23 are maternal in origin (came from our mothers). And when they get together, they form pairs called homologous pairs. These homologous pairs have genes controlling the same features in the same position \u2013 or locus \u2013 on the chromosome. However, the alleles may not be the same. Figure 3.3 shows the loci of three genes on a pair of homologous chromosomes. Gene 1 has two alleles P and P. Both chromosomes have the dominant P allele (we say that the individual is homozygous for the dominant allele). Gene 2 has two alleles, a and a. Both chromosomes have the recessive allele a (homozygous for the recessive allele). Gene 3 has alleles B and b. One chromosome has the dominant allele, B, whilst the other has the recessive allele, b. We say that the individual is heterozygous for this particular gene. The alleles of a particular gene possessed by an individual are its genotype (for that feature). The actual result of that genotype (whether or not the earlobes are attached, for example) is the phenotype (for that feature). If you know the genotypes of two parents, you can make predictions about the type and proportions of offspring they will have in relation to a particular feature. You can also throw that into reverse: if you know proportions of offspring showing certain versions of a feature, you can often work out the genotypes of the parents. Just how we do this, you will learn in the next part of this section.",

        "chunk_text": "First, let us make clear what we are talking about. A monohybrid cross is a genetic cross or breeding situation that relates to just one trait or feature. The \u2018father\u2019 of genetics, the man who discovered the rules by which genes are inherited, was the Austrian monk Gregor Mendel. Living and experimenting in a monastery in Brno, Mendel experimented with pea plants and was able to deduce the rules of inheritance from his results. He noticed that pea plants exhibited \u2018contrasting characteristics\u2019. For example, the plants were either tall or short, had purple flowers or white flowers. Now not all tall pea plants are exactly the same height, neither are all dwarf ones. But you wouldn\u2019t mistake a tall plant for a dwarf one. And obviously, you wouldn\u2019t mistake a purple-flowered plant for a white-flowered one. This was the key that enabled Mendel to experiment successfully \u2013 there were never any medium-height pea plants or plants with pale purple flowers.

        "chunk_text": "Mendel was very methodical. His starting point was to wonder what would happen if he cross-bred two pea plants with contrasting features \u2013 for example, plants with purple flowers and plants with white flowers. Before he carried out any breeding experiments, he self-pollinated the plants for several generations, and eventually used plants from a \u2018breeding line\u2019 that had contained only purple-flowered plants or white-flowered plants. These he called \u2018true-breeding\u2019 plants. He then cross-bred them in the following way. We will use flower colour as our example, but he used the same procedure for all the contrasting characteristics. 1. He removed stamens from the flowers of the purple-flowered plant (so that these flowers could not pollinate themselves). 2. He used a paintbrush to transfer pollen from the flowers of the white-flowered plant to the carpel of the purple flowers. 3. This pollinated carpel then produced a pea pod containing several pea seeds. 4. He collected and grew all the seeds from all the pods. 5. When the plants were mature, he noted the colour of their flowers. Mendel also carried out reciprocal crosses. In this case he also pollinated white-flowered plants with pollen from purple-flowered plants. In the above cross, all the offspring (which we call the F or first filial generation) have purple flowers. Mendel then allowed these purple-flowered plants to self-pollinate themselves. In the next generation (the F or second filial generation) he found a ratio of very nearly three purple-flowered plants for every one white-flowered plant. This pattern repeated itself in all of his experiments. In each case he: \u2022 crossed pure-breeding plants with contrasting characteristics \u2022 found that only one of the characteristics appeared in the F generation (always the same one \u2013 always purple flowers, for example, never white), and \u2022 found a ratio of 3:1 in the F generation (always 3 of the one that had appeared in the F and 1 of the one that hadn\u2019t). It was this pattern that led Mendel to formulate his laws and to coin the terms dominant and recessive. He used the term dominant to describe the allele that determined the trait that appeared in the F and the term recessive to describe the allele that determined the trait that did not appear in the F . Table 3.1 summarises the results for all Mendel\u2019s breeding experiments. The overall ratio for the F generation is 2.99:1. This could hardly be nearer to 3:1 and, indeed, caused some biologists to accuse him of falsifying his results. However, most believe that he was just an exceptionally meticulous experimenter. Mendel explained these results in the following way: 1. Every trait (like flower colour, or seed shape, or seed colour) is controlled by two \u2018heritable factors\u2019 \u2013 these are what we now call genes. The heritable factors (genes) may take different forms (alleles). 2. If the two alleles in an individual are different, one is dominant (will be expressed in the organism\u2019s appearance or physiology) and one is recessive (cannot be expressed unless the individual has two copies of the recessive allele). Dominant traits mask the appearance of recessive traits. 3. The only physical link between the generations is the gametes or sex cells. These must pass the genes from one generation to the next. 4. The heritable factors (alleles) separate when the gametes (sex cells) are formed; each gamete therefore contains only one allele controlling the trait. This is Mendel\u2019s \u2018law of segregation\u2019. He also stated that the gametes (sex cells) fuse randomly at fertilisation.",

The only possible way is to carry out a breeding experiment. However, this is not possible with humans, so we must look at any children they may have, or perhaps gain clues from their parents. But first, let\u2019s look at the breeding experiment. The particular experiment to find out if an organism is homozygous or heterozygous for a dominant trait is called the test cross or the back cross. Let\u2019s again use the flower colour in pea plants as our example. If we breed the purple-flowered plant with a plant whose genotype is definitely known, we can make predictions about the outcome. This can only be a white-flowered plant, which must have two recessive white alleles. There are then two possible outcomes. These are shown in in Figure 3.9. So, if we were to carry out the cross and find that any of the offspring had white flowers, we could be certain that the original purple parent was heterozygous. We know this because any white-flowered offspring would need to inherit two recessive \u2018white\u2019 alleles \u2013 one from each parent. If all the offspring were purple-flowered, we could be almost certain that the purple-flowered plant was homozygous.

        "chunk_text": "Mendel was very fortunate in his choice of organisms with which to experiment. All the alleles of all the genes involved in his experiments did segregate. But this does not always happen; some genes are always inherited together with other genes \u2013 they exhibit linkage. This happens when the genes in question are on the same chromosome. A chromosome is a physical unit as are the genes on it, so when a particular chromosome is passed into a gamete, all the genes on that chromosome pass into the gamete and none of them pass into another gamete. The genes are linked and inherited together because they are on the same chromosome. One of the earliest studies of linkage was carried out by two British geneticists, Bateson and Punnett (who also devised the Punnett square). They investigated the inheritance of flower colour (purple or red) and seed shape (round or long) in sweet peas. The alleles are: \u2022 P \u2013 purple (dominant) \u2022 p \u2013 red (recessive) \u2022 L \u2013 long (dominant) \u2022 l \u2013 round (recessive) If we were to cross individuals heterozygous for two features, then we normally would expect the 9:3:3:1 ratio typical of dihybrid inheritance. But these are linked genes, and, because they are linked, the two genes are inherited as a single unit. Starting from pure-breeding (homozygous) parents which were: \u2022 purple-flowered with long seeds (PL/PL) \u2022 white-flowered with round seeds (pl/pl), We can predict what might happen over two generations using the standard genetic diagram. Parent genotypes PL/PL \u00d7 pl/pl Gametes PL pl F1 genotypes PL/pl (self-fertilised) Gametes male female PL pl PL pl We now predict not a 9:3:3:1 ratio, but a 3:1 ratio of purple-flowered, long-seeded plants to red-flowered, round-seeded plants. Because the two genes are behaving as a single unit, it is like carrying out a monohybrid cross. Because the genes are inherited in this way, we wouldn\u2019t predict any plants that had either purple flowers with round seeds or red flowers with long seeds. But the story doesn\u2019t end there. We mustn\u2019t forget that when these gametes are formed, they are formed by meiosis and that this involves crossing over at prophase I. The consequence of this is some gametes do contain the combination Pl and others contain pL. So we do, in fact, get the four types of offspring from a cross between two plants both heterozygous for both features \u2013 but not in a 9:3:3:1 ratio. The procedure and results from Bateson and Punnett\u2019s original investigation are summarised in figure 3.22. What we might have expected from a 9:3:3:1 ratio is: \u2022 215 purple, long \u2022 71 purple, round \u2022 71 red, long \u2022 24 red, round and from a 3:1 ratio: \u2022 286 purple, long \u2022 95 red, round The reason we do not get either is because the genes are linked, but there is some crossing over between them during prophase of meiosis I. This produces the types we would not expect from linked inheritance. These types are called recombinant types. Much of the early research on crossing over and recombination was carried out using fruit flies. They are convenient experimental animals because: \u2022 they are small animals with a short life cycle (just two weeks) \u2022 they are cheap and easy to breed and keep in large numbers \u2022 they have only four pairs of chromosomes per cell \u2022 the chromosomes are large and easily observed \u2022 staining reveals dark bands which correspond to particular genes Using fruit flies in the early 1900s, Thomas Morgan was able to prove, finally, that genes carried on chromosomes are the physical basis of inheritance. One of his students, A H Sturtevant, worked on linkage and crossing over in Drosophila. In these experiments, he made predictions about what offspring to expect if there was no crossing over and then counted the number of expected and recombinant types to find the percentage of recombinant types. This percentage of recombinant types is called the crossover value and is a measure of how far apart the genes are on a chromosome. A low crossover frequency indicates that the genes are close together; a high one that they are further apart. This has been used in creating gene maps of chromosomes, where the percentage crossover values are used as \u2018units of separation\u2019 of the genes on the chromosome. The chance of crossing over occurring between two genes depends on how far apart they are on the chromosome. If they are very close together, then it is unlikely that crossing over will occur between the genes; if they are further apart, it is more likely that crossing over will occur between them and that recombinant types will be formed. Suppose three genes A, B and C have loci on the same chromosome. From investigations, the crossover values are found to be: \u2022 A and B \u2013 7% \u2022 A and C \u2013 5% \u2022 B and C \u2013 12% This can only hold true if the genes are arranged as shown below: 7 units 5 units ______B______A____C___________ 12 units Gene mapping has been used to \u2018track down\u2019 genes that cause disease (for example, cystic fibrosis and Huntington\u2019s disease) so that the DNA of the gene can be cloned for analysis and research.",

        "chunk_text": "Both cross-breeding and inbreeding are aspects of the same process \u2013 selective breeding \u2013 where organisms are chosen to breed with a specific outcome in mind. In grade 10, you learned about some examples of cross-breeding in Ethiopia. Now we must extend that a little to understand a little more of the genetic principles behind cross-breeding. Cross-breeding is an established breeding method used in sheep and beef cattle breeding to increase overall productivity. It has been used throughout the world and there is a lot of evidence to support the production gains possible from cross-breeding. Commercial cattle farmers may cross-breed animals for two related reasons: \u2022 to take advantage of hybrid vigour \u2022 to take advantage of the good qualities of two or more breeds and to combine these qualities to improve market suitability Hybrid vigour occurs when unrelated breeds or lines (of the same species) are cross-bred. In many cases the offspring from these crosses are more productive (higher milk yields, more beef per carcass) than the average of their parent breeds. The extra performance observed through hybrid vigour is simply the recovery of production losses that occurred through inbreeding in the parental breeds. Hybrid vigour is reduced when animals produced by cross-breeding are mated together. So what is going on? When a new variety of a species is established, organisms of that type are often bred only with each other. This is called inbreeding and, whilst it helps to produce a pure line (remember Mendel\u2019s pea plants?), it often reduces the productivity of the line. When two lines or varieties are cross-bred, the offspring (the F1 hybrid) results in an increase in the number of genes that are heterozygous. The \u2018pure lines\u2019 that were used would each be homozygous dominant for the genes which give them their particular characteristics. Crossing the two results in offspring with more dominant alleles, albeit in heterozygous form. However, since the dominant allele in a heterozygote often has the same effect as a dominant allele in a homozygote, this increase in the heterozygosity is what causes the increased vigour of the hybrid. Figure 3.24 shows some of the effects of hybrid vigour in cattle. In addition to making use of hybrid vigour, cross-breeding can have the advantage of allowing breeds to be chosen for complementary characteristics. For example, cattle produced by cross-breeding dairy and beef breeds can have high milk yields and the ability to produce many calves. However, if mated with large bulls, the offspring of these cattle also grow to large sizes, making them good beef cattle. It would not be possible to achieve both these outcomes with either pure-bred dairy cattle or pure-bred beef cattle. It is important at the outset to choose the cattle carefully \u2013 to check that they are likely to produce the desired result. The same principles can apply in breeding crops. Cross-breeding, natural or planned, has been important in producing many of the high-yielding crop plants we now grow. Figure 3.25A shows a plant breeding station for maize where scientists can test hybrids and their yields. Figure 3.25B shows the healthy and high-yielding \u2018corn cobs\u2019 produced by hybrids.",

        "chunk_text": "DNA \u2013 Deoxyribo-Nucleic Acid is one of two types of nucleic\nacids. The other is RNA \u2013 Ribo-Nucleic Acid. You already know\nsomething of the structure of DNA from your grade 10 work on\ngenetics, and your studies of biological molecules in grade 11, but\nlet\u2019s recap these basics. Figure 3.34 shows part of a DNA molecule.\nYou can see that it is made of two strands joined together and\nwound into a double helix. If you look carefully, you will see that\nthe structures in one strand are \u2018upside down\u2019 when compared to\nthe same structures in the other. This is because the strands are\n\u2018anti-parallel\u2019. The \u2018start\u2019 of one strand is paired with the \u2018end\u2019 of the\nother strand.\nThe basic unit of a DNA strand is a nucleotide. There are four types\nof nucleotides. These are:\n\u2022 Adenine-containing nucleotide\n\u2022 Guanine-containing nucleotide\n\u2022 Cytosine-containing nucleotide, and\n\u2022 Thymine-containing nucleotide (in DNA, or Uracil-containing\nnucleotide in RNA).\nAs you learned in grade 11, all nucleotides have the same three\ncomponents:\n\u2022 a phosphate group\n\u2022 a pentose sugar (deoxyribose in DNA nucleotides and ribose in\nRNA nucleotides)\n\u2022 one of four nitrogenous bases \u2013 Adenine, Cytosine, Guanine and\neither Thymine (DNA) or Uracil (RNA)\nThe structure of a nucleotide is shown in figure 3.35.\nDNA is a huge molecule made from two anti-parallel\npolynucleotide strands. The nucleotides are held together by bonds\nbetween the sugar in one nucleotide and the phosphate group in\nthe next. The base does not take in this linking of the nucleotides\nin a strand. For this reason, we sometimes say that there is a \u2018sugar-\nphosphate backbone\u2019 holding each DNA strand together. The\nnucleotides in one strand are paired with nucleotides in the other\naccording to the base-pairing rule.\nThis states:\n\u2022 Adenine-containing nucleotides will always be opposite\nThymine-containing nucleotides\n\u2022 Cytosine-containing nucleotides will always be opposite\nGuanine-containing nucleotides\nBecause of this base-pairing rule, all the bases on one strand of a\nDNA molecule are base-paired to those on the other strand. We say\nthat the sequences of bases on the two strands are complementary.\nDNA is a very stable molecule at normal temperatures. The\nindividual hydrogen bonds that hold the two strands together are\nquite weak, but the sheer number of them in the whole molecule\nensures that the two strands stay in position. The bonds that hold\nthe nucleotides together in each strand are much stronger than the\nhydrogen bonds. The stability of the DNA molecule is important in\nensuring that the genetic code \u2013 held in the DNA molecule \u2013 does\nnot become corrupted in any way.",

        "chunk_text": "The ability of a DNA molecule to make an exact copy of itself is the basis of all methods of reproduction and the basis of passing on genetic information from one generation to the next. When cells divide, it is important that the daughter cells formed (unless sex cells are being formed) contain the same genetic information as the parent cell that produced them. To achieve this, DNA must be able to replicate itself exactly. DNA molecules exist within chromosomes in the nucleus and are surrounded by a \u2018soup\u2019 of free DNA nucleotides \u2013 the \u2018building blocks\u2019 with which to build new DNA molecules. Even though they did not know the details, in 1953, Watson and Crick (the discoverers of the structure of DNA) proposed that DNA must replicate semi-conservatively. This means that the DNA molecule replicates in such a way that: \u2022 each new DNA molecule formed contains one strand from the original DNA \u2022 both new DNA molecules formed are identical to each other and to the original molecule The process involves several enzymes and proteins, but the key stages are as follows: \u2022 Molecules of the enzyme DNA helicase break hydrogen bonds and \u2018unwind\u2019 part of the helix of the DNA molecule, revealing two single-stranded regions. \u2022 Molecules of DNA polymerase follow the helicase along each single-stranded region, which acts as a template for the synthesis of a new strand. \u2022 The DNA polymerase assembles free DNA nucleotides into a new strand alongside each of the template strands. The base sequence in each of these new strands is complementary to its template strand because of the base-pairing rule, A-T, C-G. \u2022 The processes of unwinding followed by complementary strand synthesis progresses along the whole length of the DNA molecule. \u2022 The result is two DNA molecules that are identical to each other (and to the original molecule); each contains one strand from the original DNA molecule and one newly synthesised strand that is complementary to this.",

        "chunk_text": "The term clone is often applied to whole organisms as well as to genes. A clone of organisms is a group of organisms produced asexually from one parent. The members of the clone are genetically identical to each other and to the parent organism. Plant cuttings are clones and the thousands of plants produced from one parent by micropropagation also represent a clone. To take a simple \u2018stem cutting\u2019, just cut off a region of a stem near to a bud \u2013 as shown in figure 3.37. Remove some of the leaves so that it will not lose too much water. Dip the cut end in some hormone rooting powder and plant the cutting in some compost. Keep the cutting well watered and within a few weeks it will have developed its own root system and be an independent plant. It will be genetically identical to the parent plant the cutting was taken from. If several are taken from one plant, they will form a clone. Cloning plants by taking cuttings has been practised for thousands of years. More recently the technique of micropropagation made it possible to produce a clone of thousands of identical plants from just one parent plant. Typically, a small section of the growing point of a shoot is taken and sub-divided. These small groups of a few hundred cells are placed in test tubes containing a special medium with hormones that induce root growth. They are then transferred to another medium containing hormones to induce shoot growth. When they have grown sufficiently, the small plantlets are transferred to a compost and grown on. In this way, thousands of identical plants can be produced. Most of the world\u2019s bananas are now produced by micropropagation. The reason why it is relatively easy to clone plants is that many more plant cells retain the ability to divide than is the case in animals. You cannot just cut off a piece of animal and place it in a special medium and watch it grow! However, animals have been cloned. The first mammal to be cloned, and still the most famous, was Dolly the sheep. Dolly\u2019s genetic mother was a type of sheep called \u2018Finn-Dorset\u2019. Dolly was produced by transferring a diploid nucleus to an egg cell that had been enucleated (had its nucleus removed). Once the nucleus had been successfully transferred, the egg cell was stimulated to divide by a small electric current. When development had reached a stage called a blastocyst, the embryo was implanted into a surrogate \u2018mother\u2019 ewe. Seven months later, Dolly was born. She was genetically identical to the Finn-Dorset ewe (female sheep) from whom the genetic material had been obtained. Figure 3.38 summarises these procedures.",

They continue to provide strong evidence because, with the exception of identical twins, an individual\u2019s fingerprints are unique. They do not change throughout life.\nGenetic fingerprinting has nothing to do with actual fingerprints. It is a technique for comparing the DNA of different people. Much of the DNA in the cells of the body is what is known as non-coding DNA. The non-coding DNA is found between genes and contains base sequences that are repeated, sometimes many times over. These repeating sequences of non-coding DNA are called mini-satellites and it is these that form the basis of a genetic fingerprint. The mini-satellites are inherited along with the coding DNA from one or other parent.\nThe DNA used for analysis can be obtained from a sample of blood (white blood cells could supply the DNA), skin or semen \u2013 in fact, from any type of cell that has a nucleus. If the sample does not contain sufficient DNA for analysis, then the amount can be amplified using the polymerase chain reaction.\nThe main stages in preparing a genetic fingerprint are as follows:\n\u2022 DNA is isolated from the cells.\n\u2022 The DNA is cut into fragments using one or more restriction enzymes. The fragments that are obtained are treated with alkali to separate the strands of each DNA fragment.\n\u2022 The fragments are separated by gel electrophoresis. Smaller fragments (with a lower molecular mass) move further than larger fragments.\n\u2022 The (invisible) pattern of separated DNA fragments is transferred from the gel to a nylon membrane. The membrane is placed over the gel in a tray of \u2018flow-buffer\u2019 and is held in place by paper towels and a weight. The buffer soaks up through the gel, carrying the fragments of DNA with it. The buffer can pass through the membrane (to be absorbed by the paper towels), but the DNA cannot. It remains in the nylon membrane in the same relative position as it was in the gel.\n\u2022 A radioactive gene probe is applied to the membrane. This is made of single-stranded DNA (called c-DNA) and binds with base sequences in the mini-satellite regions.\n\u2022 The membrane is placed over a piece of X-ray film to reveal the positions of those fragments that have bound to the probe.\nThe chance of two people having the same genetic fingerprint (unless they are identical twins) is about 1 in 1 000 000. This means that a genetic fingerprint can be used to provide strong evidence of involvement in or innocence of a crime.\nLook at the fingerprints in figure 3.44 of a person accused of attacking a person, together with the victim\u2019s genetic fingerprint. Clearly the blood on the defendant\u2019s clothes has the same DNA as the victim\u2019s blood \u2013 it must be the victim\u2019s blood. So this is strong evidence that the defendant was at least present at the time.",

A debate about right and wrong involves the principles of ethics and morality.\n\u2022 Morality is our personal sense of what is right, or acceptable, and what is wrong. Morality is not necessarily linked to legality.\n\u2022 Ethics also involve a sense of right and wrong. However, ethics are not individual opinions. They represent the \u2018code\u2019 adopted by a particular group to govern its way of life.\nMany people have passionate views about genetic engineering. Some hold an unshakeable belief in the technology, which they see as something that will bring great benefits to humankind. Other people hold the equally strong belief that genetic engineering is tampering with nature and is likely to cause serious ecological and physiological problems. Some of the issues people are concerned about are discussed below.\n\u2022 A species is sacrosanct and should not be altered genetically in any way. This is a personal, moral viewpoint. People who take this moral stance usually do so on the basis that the genes from one species would not normally find their way into another species. However, genes have been \u2018jumping\u2019 from one species to another (albeit at a very low frequency) for millions of years.\n\u2022 Not enough is known about the long-term ecological effects of introducing genetically modified organisms into the field. They may outcompete wild plants and take over an area. This is also a moral viewpoint. The effects of any new crop cannot be determined without field trials. Ten thousand years ago, the early farmers who cross-bred wild wheat plants to produce the forerunner of today\u2019s strains could not have known what impact these would have. Does this make it wrong?\n\u2022 If plants are genetically engineered to be resistant to herbicides, the gene could \u2018jump\u2019 into populations of weeds and other wild plants. This is perfectly true \u2013 it could. However, non-genetically modified herbicide-resistant strains of plants already exist. The gene could just as easily jump from these.\n\u2022 Gene technology might give doctors the ability to create designer babies. It could become possible to obtain a newly fertilised human egg, determine its genotype and ask the parents which genes they would like to be modified. Initially, only genes that cause disease might be replaced. Subsequently, the technology might be used to replace other genes. Most doctors would find this morally and ethically unacceptable. They might consider replacing genes that cause disease but not replacing genes merely to improve a child\u2019s image in the eyes of its parents. However, if such practices become possible, who will define for doctors what is ethically acceptable? What will be the dividing line between cosmetic gene therapy and medical gene therapy?\n\u2022 Using genetic fingerprinting to combat crime will only be useful if there is a genetic database \u2013 a file of the genetic fingerprints of everyone in the country, so that a genetic fingerprint found at the scene of a crime could instantly implicate that person. But who will have access to this information? There are concerns that a genetic database would be subject to misuse. If insurance companies had access to the genetic database, they might refuse insurance (or charge higher premiums) to people with an increased risk of, say, heart disease. Employers could (covertly) refuse employment to people because their \u2018genetic profiles\u2019 did not meet particular requirements. A recent ruling from the European court states that the police have no right to hold the DNA of someone unless they have been convicted of a crime.\nBut you should also consider the fact that biotechnology (including gene technology) is sometimes merely a refinement of less controversial practices. Organic farmers use the naturally occurring soil bacterium Bacillus thuringiensis as a non-chemical insecticide. Genetic engineers have extracted a gene from this bacterium and transferred it to cotton plants to make them resistant to attack by insects. Is there any real difference? People have known for centuries that rubbing a certain blue mould onto cuts can stop them turning septic. In 1922, Alexander Fleming discovered penicillin in the blue mould Penicillium.",

        "chunk_text": "The genetic code is held in the DNA molecule. As you already know from your studies in grade 10, it is the sequence of bases in the nucleotides of the DNA that makes up a gene that codes for the protein and that each amino acid in the protein is coded for by a triplet (sequence of three) of bases. This gives us a useful definition of a gene: A gene is a sequence of base triplets in the DNA molecule that carries the code for a protein. With four different bases to work with (adenine, thymine, cytosine and guanine), there are 64 possible triplet codes, but only 20 amino acids are used to make all the different proteins. What is the purpose of the other 44 codes? In fact, none of these is spare or redundant. However, only one of the strands of the DNA molecule carries the code for proteins. This is called the coding strand or the sense strand. The other strand is the non-coding or antisense strand. Most amino acids have more than one code. Only methionine and tryptophan have just one triplet that codes for them; arginine has six. Three of the triplets (TAA, TAG and TGA) do not code for amino acids at all. They are \u2018stop\u2019 codes that signify the end of a coding sequence. Because there is this extra capacity in the genetic code, over and above what is essential, it is said to be a degenerate code. Besides being a triplet and degenerate code, the DNA code is a non-overlapping code. This means that each triplet is distinct from all other triplets. The last base in one triplet cannot also be the first base (or second base) in another triplet. The genetic code is also a universal code. This means that the triplet TAT is the DNA code for the amino acid tyrosine in a human, a giant redwood tree, a bacterium or in any other living organism. The 64 DNA triplets and the amino acids they code for are shown in two different ways in figures 3.47A and B. Notice the \u2018stop\u2019 codes. In this method of representing the genetic code, start with one of the \u2018biggest\u2019 letters in the centre. This represents the first base in the triplet. One of the four medium-sized letters in the next layer out represents the second base and the smallest letters represent the third base in the triplet. Outside that is the name of the amino acid for which the triplet codes. So, ACC codes for threonine. GGG codes for glycine. In this method of representing the genetic code, start with the letters at the left-hand side of the table. These represent the first base in the triplet. They define which row in the table to look in. The letters across the top represent the second base in the triplet and define which column in the table to look in. The letters at the right of the table represent the third base in the triplet and define which line in the row to look in. So, again, A (third row), C (second column) and C (second line) is the code for threonine and GGG the code for glycine.",

The mRNA codons are identical to the DNA triplets that code for specific amino acids, except that U (uracil) is substituted for T (thymine). To form the single-stranded mRNA when transcription takes place, only the antisense strand of DNA is transcribed. This is because the sense strand of this section contains the gene that codes for a protein. However, transcribing this would produce a complementary sequence of bases, similar to those in the antisense strand, which would not code for anything. In eukaryotic cells, transcription takes place in the following way: \u2022 The enzyme DNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RNA polymerase) binds with a section of DNA next to the gene to be transcribed. \u2022 Transcription factors (see later) activate the enzyme. \u2022 The enzyme begins to \u2018unwind\u2019 a section of DNA. RNA polymerase moves along the antisense strand, using it as a template for synthesising the mRNA. \u2022 The polymerase assembles free RNA nucleotides into a chain in which the base sequence is complementary to the base sequence on the antisense strand of the DNA. This, therefore, carries the same triplet code as the sense strand (except that uracil replaces thymine). \u2022 The completed molecule leaves the DNA; the strands of DNA rejoin and re-coil.

Ribosomes are made from ribosomal RNA (rRNA) and proteins organised into a large and a small subunit. Within the ribosome, there are three sites that can be occupied by a tRNA molecule, called the A, P and E sites. The following events take place: \u2022 The first two codons of the mRNA enter the ribosome. \u2022 Transfer RNA molecules (with amino acids attached) that have complementary anticodons to the first two codons of the mRNA bind to those codons. \u2022 A peptide bond forms between the amino acids carried by these two tRNA molecules and the dipeptide is transferred to the tRNA in the A site. \u2022 The ribosome moves along the mRNA by one codon, bringing the third codon into the ribosome; at the same time the \u2018free\u2019 tRNA exits the ribosome and the tRNA with the dipeptide moves into the P site. \u2022 A tRNA with a complementary anticodon binds with the third codon, bringing its amino acid into position next to the second amino acid. \u2022 A peptide bond forms between the second and third amino acids. \u2022 The ribosome moves along the mRNA by one codon, bringing the fourth mRNA codon into the ribosome, and the whole process is repeated until a \u2018stop\u2019 codon is in position and translation ceases.

There can be large structural changes involving whole chromosomes or parts of chromosomes, or changes that involve only a single base. The changes involving only a single base are called point mutations, and it is these that we are mainly concerned with. There are several types of point mutation, in which one of the bases in the DNA sequence of a gene is altered, usually by being copied wrongly when the DNA replicates. The different point mutations are:\n\u2022 substitution\n\u2022 addition\n\u2022 deletions\nThese mutations occur quite randomly when DNA is replicating and each involves a change to just one base, but the change to the gene can be dramatic and the result can be that the protein the gene should code for is not made at all or a different protein is made.",

Substitutions affect just one triplet and, because the DNA code is degenerate, may well have no overall effect \u2013 the same protein may still be produced. This can never be the case with additions and deletions. The reason for this is that they do not just alter the triplet in which the mutation occurs. Because there is one fewer or one extra base, the whole sequence after the point of the mutation is altered. We say that there has been a frameshift and these are frameshift mutations. A totally different mRNA is produced (if one is produced at all) and a non-functional protein or no protein at all. Sometimes, a whole triplet is missed out or inserted. This will result in either one extra or one fewer codon in the mRNA. In turn, this will lead to one extra or one fewer amino acid in the polypeptide chain.\nAnother way of thinking about frameshifts\nLook of this sequence of letters:\nTHEMANWASHOTANDRANFORHISHAT\nIf we give this a \u2018reading frame\u2019 of three letters, it becomes:\nTHE MAN WAS HOT AND RAN FOR HIS HAT\nand it makes sense.

However, if the mutation occurs in a sex cell, or a cell that will divide to give rise to a sex cell, then it may be passed on to the next generation. Mutations in different genes will obviously produce different effects, but two types of genes are really important. Genes called proto-oncogenes and tumour suppressor genes play important roles in regulating cell division and preventing the formation of a tumour. When proto-oncogenes mutate, they often become active oncogenes, which stimulate the cell to divide in an uncontrolled manner. Ordinarily, some growth factor would be necessary to make the cell divide. Tumour suppressor genes recognise uncontrolled cell division and act to suppress cell division.

Crossing over, segregation and random assortment in meiosis together with random fusion in fertilisation reshuffle existing genetic material, but only mutation produces new genetic material. If a mutated allele gives an organism an advantage then Natural Selection will act so that frequency of that allele increases with successive generations. As it does the numbers of the organism with the mutated allele will also increase, at the expense of those without it. Mutations in the DNA of bacteria can give them resistance to a specific antibiotic, such as penicillin or ampicillin. These mutations arise spontaneously, as do all mutations. They only give the bacterium an advantage if the particular antibiotic is actually being used. Being resistant to streptomycin is no advantage if penicillin is being used. But being resistant to penicillin in an environment where penicillin is widely used confers a considerable advantage to the organisms. In 1947, just four years after penicillin was used widely in the USA, the first penicillin-resistant bacterium was found \u2013 it was a bacterium called Staphylococcus aureus. Today over half the infections caused by Staphylococcus aureus are caused by penicillin-resistant types. Bacteria can also \u2018swap\u2019 antibiotic resistance genes with each other.

And we often put ourselves right at the pinnacle of evolution, as though things \u2018could not get any better than this\u2019. We have something like the summary shown in figure 4.1 in mind.\nBut what is happening? How did all these millions of new species appear? We need a working definition of evolution which will take into account what is happening. Obviously, change is important when trying to explain evolution. Organisms have changed over time \u2013 they have evolved; we almost use the two words interchangeably. But why would an organism change? And would it matter if just one organism changed? For new species to appear, groups of organisms \u2013 populations \u2013 have to change, not just single organisms. For them to change, their genes must change, as the genes define what they will be by controlling protein synthesis (see unit 3).\nSo we can come up with a working definition of the process of evolution as:\nThe change in genetic composition of a population over successive generations, which may be caused by meiosis, hybridisation, natural selection or mutation. This leads to a sequence of events by which the population diverges from other populations of the same species and may lead to the origin of a new species.",

There are fundamental differences between the two that mean it is unlikely that the difference between the scientific theory of evolution and special creation will ever be resolved. Science describes the natural world around us using a means of observation and empirical testing using instruments. These observations then result in the development of scientific theories. There is no attempt on the part of science to give opinions about morality or purpose.\nReligion mainly focuses on spiritual matters that, by their very nature, cannot be seen, touched or measured effectively. Religion deals with philosophical matter that relates to morality and concerns between humans and their God. Religion is less concerned with empirical observable facts and testable hypotheses but rather with faith, the belief in things that cannot be proven.\nScience relies on provable events; religion relies on believing in that which cannot be proven. The two views are very, very different from each other even though each is a valid worldview in its own context.\nSpecial creation states that at some stage, some supreme being created life on Earth. There are many different versions of special creation, linked with different religions. Often, there is considerable variation as to how rigidly the special creation theory is interpreted within a religion.\nYoung Earth creationism\nThis form of creationism today suggests that the Earth is only a few thousand years old. Young Earth creationists often believe the Earth was created in six 24-hour days. While they agree that the Earth is round and moves around the Sun, they interpret all geology in the light of Noah\u2019s flood.\nOld Earth creationism\nThere are several types of creationism that are considered Old Earth. They vary in different aspects of how they explain the age of the Earth while still holding to the story found in Genesis. Those who believe in Old Earth creationism accept the evidence that the Earth is very old but still maintain that all life was created by God.\nDay-age and gap creationism\nThese are similar in that each interprets the beginnings of the creation story as actually having taken much longer than six Earth days.\n\u2022 Gap creation discusses a large gap between the formation of the Earth and the creation of all the animals and humans. The gap could be millions or billions of years. This gets around the scientific evidence that the Earth is several billion years old without having to believe in the process of evolution itself.\n\u2022 Day-age creationism is similar in the length of time but talks about each of the six \u2018days\u2019 as really meaning a billion years or so geologic time; the \u2018days\u2019 are just symbolic.\nProgressive creationism\nThis type of creationism accepts the Big Bang as the origin of the Universe. It accepts the fossil record of a series of creations for all of the organisms catalogued. However, it does not accept these as part of a continuing process; each is seen as a unique creation. Modern species are not seen as being genetically related to ancient ones.\nTheistic evolution/Evolutionary creationism\nThis view of evolution maintains that God \u2018invented\u2019 evolution and takes some form of an active part in the ongoing process of evolution. It also invokes the role of God in areas not discussed by science, like the creation of the human soul. Theistic evolution is promoted by the Pope for the Catholic Church and is also espoused by most mainline Protestants.\nIntelligent design\nThis is the newest version of creationism and maintains that God\u2019s handiwork can be seen in all of creation if one knows where to look. Advocates of intelligent design offer sophisticated arguments, often based on cell biology and mathematics, to give the impression of complex scientific arguments and to create equal stature with mainstream scientific thought. These arguments attack different parts of evolutionary theory, with the idea that if one part of evolutionary theory can be found to be incorrect then it follows that all of evolution must be incorrect. The term intelligent design is used to mask the fact that it\u2019s a form of creationism cloaked in scientific-sounding ideas.",

Exclude the flies, as he did with some jars, and the meat does not produce either maggots or flies.\nLouis Pasteur showed that broth (or wine) only went sour if micro-organisms were allowed to enter.

Oparin suggested that the simple organic compounds could have undergone a series of reactions leading to more and more complex molecules. He proposed that the molecules might have formed colloidal aggregates, or \u2018coacervates\u2019, in an aqueous environment. The coacervates were able to absorb and assimilate organic compounds from the environment in a way similar to the metabolism of cells.

He proposed that the primitive sea served as a vast chemical laboratory powered by solar energy. As a result of all the reactions powered by solar energy, the sea became a \u2018hot dilute soup\u2019 of organic monomers and small polymers.

When he analysed the liquid in the water trap, he found it contained a number of simple organic molecules \u2013 hydrogen cyanide (HCN) was one of them. He found that by leaving the equipment for longer periods of time, a larger variety and more complex organic molecules were formed including: \u2022 amino acids \u2013 essential to form proteins \u2022 pentose sugars \u2013 needed to form nucleic acids \u2022 hexose sugars \u2013 needed for respiration and to form starch and cellulose \u2022 hydrogen cyanide again \u2013 but it has been shown that the nitrogenous bases found in nucleotides can be synthesised in the laboratory using HCN as a starting point There is then considerable evidence to support the Oparin\u2013Haldane hypothesis. But it is not without its problems. These include: \u2022 Why are only \u2018left-handed\u2019 amino acids found in living things when both left-handed and right-handed types are possible? \u2022 Although nitrogenous bases can be synthesised in the laboratory, purines (adenine and guanine) are not synthesised under the same conditions as pyrimidines (thymine, uracil and cytosine); this is quite a serious problem for the theory. \u2022 Although Miller was able to demonstrate the formation of monomers in his investigation, he was unable to demonstrate the next significant step of polymerisation of these monomers. Recently, progress has been made in all of these areas. In 2009, John Sutherland, a chemist at the University of Manchester in England, found that, instead of making the nitrogenous base and sugar separately from chemicals likely to have existed on the primitive Earth, under the right conditions the base and sugar could be built up as a single unit (a nucleotide), and so did not need to be linked. It has also been shown that polymerisation can occur under appropriate conditions and a solution is in sight for the \u2018handedness\u2019 problem.

Other primitive autotrophs used not light as a source of energy but chemical reactions and are called chemo-autotrophs. Chemo-autotrophs use the energy from chemical reactions to synthesise all",

        "chunk_text": "In section 1 we arrived at a definition of evolution as:\nThe change in genetic composition of a population over successive\ngenerations, which may be caused by meiosis, hybridisation, natural\nselection or mutation. This leads to a sequence of events by which the\npopulation diverges from other populations of the same species and may\nlead to the origin of a new species.\nBut how does it happen? What drives the population to become a new\nspecies? Over time there have been many theories that have attempted\nto explain this. In this section we shall look at some of them.\nWe owe much of our current thinking on natural selection to the ideas\nof Charles Darwin, who put forward the idea to the Royal Society\nin 1858. His paper suggested that those organisms that were best\nadapted to their environment would have an advantage and be able\nto reproduce in greater numbers than other types, and pass on the\nadvantageous adaptations. Because he knew nothing of genetics, he\nwas unable to suggest how this might take place.\nFor many years in Europe, the Christian belief had been that the Earth\nand all species had been created about 6000 years ago. In the mid\n1700s, George Buffon challenged this idea, suggesting that:\n\u2022 the Earth was much older than this, and that\n\u2022 organisms changed over time in response to environmental\npressures and random events.\nWhilst we now accept these ideas almost without a second thought,\nat the time Buffon had no evidence to back them up and, as a result,\nthe theory could not convince people.\nAt the start of the nineteenth century, Lamarck, having read Buffon\u2019s\nideas, made what is now considered to be the first major advance\ntowards modern evolutionary thinking because he proposed a\nmechanism by which the gradual change in species might take place.\nIn 1809 he published a paper entitled \u2018Philosophie Zoologique\u2019, in\nwhich he described a two-part mechanism by which change was\ngradually introduced into the species and passed down through\ngenerations. His theory is called the \u2018theory of transformation\u2019 or,\nmore usually, simply \u2018Lamarckism\u2019. The two parts of his theory are:\n\u2022 Use and disuse, and\n\u2022 Inheritance of acquired traits.",

According to Lamarck, a given\ngiraffe could, over a lifetime of straining to reach high branches,\noffspring develop an elongated neck. However, Lamarck could not explain\nhow this might happen. He talks about a \u2018natural tendency towards\nperfection\u2019 \u2013 but this is not really an explanation. Another example\nLamarck used to illustrate his idea was the toes of water birds. He\nsuggested that from years of straining their toes to swim through\nwater, these birds gained elongated, webbed toes to improve their\nswimming.\nThese two examples demonstrate how use could change a trait. He\nused the wings of penguins as an example to illustrate what might\nhappen to a structure with disuse. Their wings would have become\nsmaller than those of other birds because penguins do not use them\nto fly.",

We can group fossils into two categories:\nCategory 1: the remains of the dead animal or plant or the imprint left from the remains, including:\n\u2022 bones\n\u2022 teeth\n\u2022 skin impressions\n\u2022 hair\n\u2022 the hardened shell of an ancient invertebrate such as a trilobite or an ammonite\n\u2022 an impression of an animal or plant, even if the actual parts are missing\nCategory 2: something that was made by the animal while it was living that has since hardened into stone; these are called trace fossils and include:\n\u2022 footprints\n\u2022 burrows\n\u2022 coprolite (animal faeces)\nType I fossils can be the actual organism or part of an organism, like a piece of bone or hair or feather as it actually was.

This spider probably became stuck inside the sticky resin and could not escape. As the amber became fossilised, the spider was protected from micro-organisms and air which would have led to its decomposition. In many fossils like this, the soft parts of the body have been lost, but the exoskeleton is perfectly preserved. In some cases, however, the entire body remains. However, when we think of fossils, we usually think of imprints of whole organisms or parts of organisms \u2013 the last two examples of category 1 fossils. So how do these fossils form? Clearly death of the organism, for some reason or other, is the first stage.

An important point here is that these minerals are probably not the same minerals that make up the sediments (now rock).

In time, the entire shell is replaced by mineral particles and these also are compressed into rock in the shape of the original organism.

This is called stratigraphy. The oldest strata, and therefore the oldest fossils, will be in the lowest layers and more recent rocks and fossils in layers above them, with the most recent being nearest to the surface. Figure 4.21 represents the sequence of the strata at a site in southern England. The depth of the strata is related to their age. The thickness of each stratum (shown in the diagram) is a measure of the time period during which that stratum was formed. The names \u2018Tertiary\u2019, \u2018Cretaceous\u2019 and \u2018Jurassic\u2019 are the names of some of the geological periods of time. But how do we actually date the rocks? How do we find out how old each layer is? To do this, we biologists use one of two techniques: \u2022 radiocarbon dating, or \u2022 potassium\u2013argon dating. Both these techniques rely on the principle that radioactive atoms decay into other atoms over time. Radioactive carbon atoms (C14) decay into non-radioactive nitrogen atoms (N ). Radioactive potassium atoms (K40) decay into argon atoms (A40). Each has what is known as a half-life. During this period, half of the radioactive atoms decay. So, starting with a certain number of radioactive potassium atoms, after one half-life, 50% will still be radioactive. After a second half-life, 50% of this 50% will have decayed and 25% of the original number will still be radioactive. The ratio of carbon 14 (radioactive carbon) to carbon 12 (ordinary carbon) in living things is about 1 to 1 trillion and we believe that this ratio has always been the same. During their lives, living things lose carbon 14 (as carbon dioxide and other excretory products) and also gain it in the food they eat (or make in the case of autotrophs). But when living things die, the carbon 14 starts to decay into non- radioactive nitrogen and, clearly, is not replaced. So after 5730 years (one half-life of carbon 14), only 50% of the original carbon 14 atoms will remain and the ratio of carbon 14 to carbon 12 will be 1 to 2 trillion (or 0.5 to 1 trillion). After 11 460 years, 25% of the original carbon 14 atoms remain and the ratio is 1 to 4 trillion (or 0.25 to 1 trillion). The percentage of carbon 14 atoms and the ratio of carbon 14 to carbon 12 keeps halving with each half-life that passes. This is shown in figure 4.23.",

Comparative anatomy looks at structural similarities of organisms and uses these to determine their possible evolutionary relationships. It assumes that organisms with similar anatomical features are closely related evolutionarily, and that they probably share a common ancestor. Some organisms have anatomical structures that are very similar in form, but very different in function. We call such structures homologous structures. Because they are so similar, they indicate an evolutionary relationship and a common ancestor of the species that possess them. Perhaps the best-known example of homologous structures is the forelimb of mammals. When examined closely, the forelimbs of humans, whales, cats and bats are all very similar in structure, as figure 4.25 shows.\nEach possesses the same number of bones, arranged in almost the same way, while they have different external features and they function in different ways: \u2022 arm for manipulation in humans \u2022 leg for running in cats \u2022 flipper for swimming in whales \u2022 wing for flying in bats By comparing the anatomy of these limbs, scientists have determined that the basic pattern (called a pentadactyl limb) must have evolved just once and that all organisms with this kind of limb are descended from that original type \u2013 they share a common ancestor. However, comparative anatomy needs to be used carefully as evidence for evolution. Sometimes organisms have structures that function in very similar ways. However, morphologically and developmentally these structures are very different. We call these analogous structures. Because they are so different structurally, even though they have the same function, they cannot indicate that two species share a common ancestor. For example, although the wings of a bird and a mosquito both serve the same function their anatomies are very different. The bird wing has bones inside and is covered with feathers, while the mosquito wing has neither of these. They are analogous structures and have evolved separately.",

Chemicals that have been used in such analyses include: \u2022 DNA \u2013 the base sequences of DNA from different organisms is compared \u2022 proteins such as: \u2013 cytochrome c (found in the electron transport chain of respiration) and etc. \u2013 haemoglobin which are compared in terms of amino acid sequences. Species that are closely related have the most similar DNA and proteins; those that are distantly related share fewer similarities. A comparison of DNA sequences shows that it is 99.9% certain that chimpanzees are humans\u2019 closest relatives (98% of our DNA is the same as that of chimpanzees). To measure the similarity of one species\u2019 DNA with another species, we use a technique called DNA hybridisation. The technique measures the extent to which a strand of DNA from one species can bind with (or hybridise with) a strand of DNA from another species. In this technique, the double helix of the DNA molecule is heated to separate it into single strands and then the single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) from both species is mixed and the mixture cooled. Although the ssDNA from species A and species B will hybridise (bind) as it cools, it will not do so along all its length. There will be regions that are mismatched (the base pairs are not complementary) and so do not bind and there are techniques available to measure the percentage of this mismatching. The information can then be used to calculate the percentage similarity of the DNA samples.\nThe haemoglobin molecule is similar in all animals that possess it, but there are differences. For example, the haemoglobin of the lamprey (a primitive fish-like animal) has only one polypeptide chain, not four. Most animals have haemoglobin with four chains, but the chains do vary. Figure 4.28 shows the differences in the amino acid sequences of the \u03b1 chains of human and several other animals.

The advantageous types will, therefore, increase in frequency in successive generations. Natural selection is the \u2018driving force\u2019 behind evolution. It is the process that brings about changes (over time) in populations that can, eventually, lead to different populations of the same species becoming different species. To appreciate how natural selection can eventually lead to speciation (the formation of new species), we must be clear what we mean by a species. Obviously humans are a different species from chimpanzees. But the different races of humans are all members of the same species. Why? Our current definition of a species is: A group of similar organisms with a similar biochemistry, physiology and evolutionary history that can interbreed to produce offspring that are fertile. This explains why all humans are members of the same species, but belong to a different species from the chimpanzee. So how can there be different types of natural selection?

Palms growing on the different soils developed different breeding seasons (as a result of nutrient availability at different times). As a result they were reproductively isolated and developed into two different species. Interestingly, the process also involves disruptive selection.

Some human liver cells have 92 chromosomes per cell \u2013 they are tetraploid \u2013 they have four sets of chromosomes per cell.\nPolyploidy has been important in plant evolution because it has allowed otherwise infertile hybrids to become fertile again. When different species form hybrids, very often the hybrid cannot produce offspring because all the chromosomes cannot form bivalents (homologous pairs) in meiosis. So they cannot form sex cells and cannot reproduce. If the chromosome number were to double, then all chromosomes are able to form homologous pairs. Meiosis and sex-cell formation can take place and the hybrid is now fertile. Hybridisation and polyploidy have both been important in the evolution of modern wheat from wild grasses. Figure 4.36 shows how. Hybrid B is infertile because each cell contains one set of chromosomes (7) that came from Aegilops squarrosa and one set of chromosomes (14) that came from Triticum durum. Clearly, with 21 chromosomes per cell, there are not enough chromosomes for them all to form homologous pairs \u2013 even if they were homologous. But when the hybrid doubled its chromosome number, there were two of each chromosome. Now homologous pairs can form in meiosis and the hybrid is fertile. Triticum vulgare is one form of modern wheat. Polyploidy, in addition to restoring fertility to infertile hybrids, often results in bigger plants with more and bigger seeds.",

But, we are Homo sapiens and we are the latest of several humans to live on the planet. We have two features in particular that distinguish us from other primates. These are: \u2022 a very large brain, and \u2022 bipedalism \u2013 the ability to truly walk on just two legs. There was a lot of debate amongst biologists as to which of these came first and also about exactly how this \u2018evolutionary tree\u2019 has given rise to the various groups. But although they may disagree over the details, they are all agreed about the idea \u2013 a line of evolution that has branched to give the different groups of primates (including apes and humans) that exist today and have existed in the not too distant past. Figure 4.40 shows the part of the evolutionary tree of humans and the living great apes in more detail. You can see that at several points there are \u2018common ancestors\u2019. These represent branching points in the evolutionary tree. At these points it is assumed that an ancestral type became divided into at least two populations which subsequently evolved along different lines.

Humans and chimpanzees both evolved from a common ancestor that lived about 6 million years ago. So far in this section, we have talked about \u2018humans\u2019 rather than the one specific type of human (ourselves \u2013 Homo sapiens) that now inhabits the planet.

As humans moved from Africa into different areas of the world, they encountered different environments. Different selection pressures in the different environments resulted in the different human populations evolving along different lines. For example, as humans encountered colder climates, body features that gave a survival advantage by helping to conserve heat were selected for. These included: \u2022 a shorter, squatter body shape; this reduces the surface-area-to- volume ratio and so reduces the rate of heat loss by radiation \u2022 an increased layer of adipose tissue under the skin to act as insulation \u2022 increased hairiness; this reduces heat loss by convection Humans have been evolving into different \u2018races\u2019 for thousands of years. The classification of these races is difficult and there is some disagreement about their exact nature. One classification is given below. In this there are three main races with several subdivisions. This is based on a recent genetic analysis of the different races. \u2022 African (Negroid), 100 million people from Africa and Melanesians of the South Pacific. \u2022 Eurasian (Caucasoid), 1000 million people with variable skin colour ranging from white to dark brown. Three subdivisions exist: \u2013 Nordic \u2013 often tall, blonde and narrow-headed; includes people from Scandinavian and Baltic countries, Germany, France, Britain \u2013 Mediterranean \u2013 usually lighter in body build, dark and narrow-headed; includes people from Southern France, Spain, Italy, Wales, Egypt, Jews, Arabs, Afghanistan, Pakistan, India \u2013 Alpine \u2013 usually broad-headed, square jaws, olive skin, brown hair; includes people from countries from the Mediterranean to Asia \u2022 East Asian (Mongoloid), most numerous of the present-day populations and split into three groups: \u2013 Eastern Siberians, Eskimos and the Northern American Indians \u2013 Japanese, Koreans and Chinese \u2013 Indonesians and Malays However, this classification does not include the Central African pigmies, the Bushmen and the Australoids. It seems that some thousands of years ago the human populations or races might have been beginning to evolve into separate species. Certainly physical and genetic differences were emerging between the different races. However, our large brain has intervened in two major ways, described below. \u2022 We developed the skill to design and manufacture all kinds of things from buildings to tools to clothes. This effectively allowed us to become able to modify our environment, rather than having to evolve to adapt to it. Anyone can now live perfectly easily in Sweden or any other Nordic country. They must simply wear the right clothes. \u2022 We developed global travel. This has allowed humans of all races to interbreed, throwing many of the genetic differences that have evolved into a huge human melting pot. We may still evolve into diverse species, but, at the moment, the mechanisms that usually drive speciation have been modified by our large brains.

        "chunk_text": "Everyone has noticed that if you put a plant on a windowsill (where the intensity of the light will be greater on the window side than on the other side), the plant shoots grow towards the window. They grow towards the greater light intensity. This behaviour is called phototropism. Plant shoots are positively phototropic because they grow towards light. The response is even more marked in young seedlings.\nThe benefit in plant stems growing towards the greatest intensity of light is that stems automatically direct their leaves in this direction as well. This means that the chlorophyll and other pigments in the leaf cells can absorb the maximum amount of light for photosynthesis.\nThis response is co-ordinated by plant growth substances called auxins. These are produced in the shoot tip in response to light and move downwards and away from light to the \u2018dark\u2019 side of the shoot. The auxins stimulate the shoot cells to divide and enlarge, so growth is greatest on the side away from the light. As this side grows more, it causes the shoot to bend towards the light. Figure 5.3 shows how this fits our general model of behaviour.\nEveryone also knows that plant stems grow upwards and roots grow more or less downwards. The unidirectional stimulus producing this response is gravity. The response by plants to gravity is called gravitropism. Plant roots are positively gravitropic, because they grow towards gravity; plant shoots are negatively gravitropic, because they grow away from gravity. This means that the roots will grow towards an environment in which they can anchor the plant, absorb water and absorb mineral ions.",

Two different types of responses in simple organisms are given below.\n\u2022 Taxes (singular taxis), in which the animal moves along a gradient of intensity of a stimulus towards the greatest intensity of the stimulus (a positive taxis) and sometimes away from the greatest intensity (a negative taxis); there is a directional response to a directional stimulus. For example, the unicellular protoctistan Euglena swims (using its flagellum) towards areas of increased light intensity. This is positive phototaxis and allows the organism to photosynthesise efficiently.\n\u2022 Kineses (singular kinesis), in which a change in the intensity of the stimulus brings about a change in the rate of movement, not a change in the direction of movement. For example, woodlice increase their rate of movement in bright light. This increases the probability that they will move into a dark area, where it is usually more humid and they will lose less water.\nthrough their body surface. This happens quickly because they have no waxy cuticle covering their bodies to limit loss of water. They are typically found under logs, stones, bark and amongst leaf litter. These areas all have a more humid atmosphere, which reduces the rate of water loss from the woodlice. They are all also dark areas. When brought into the light, the woodlice start to move around much more quickly. This increased rate of movement is a response to the increased intensity of light \u2013 it is a kinesis. Figure 5.4 shows how this behaviour fits the general model.\nThe increased movement makes it more likely that the woodlice will, quite by chance, move into dark, humid conditions once more. Once they do, their rate of movement decreases again, making it more likely that they will remain in these more favourable conditions.",

Many of these reflexes are protective. \u2022 Those that involve sensors in internal organs and produce responses also in internal organs, called autonomic reflexes.

        "chunk_text": "The term \u2018biological clock\u2019 is used to describe some internal regulatory mechanism that controls various cyclical responses in living things. Both plants and animals show yearly, monthly, daily and other cyclical changes that are genetically programmed. Because these clocks are present in so many different types of organisms, biologists believe that they have evolved independently in these groups and are an example of convergent evolution. Daily rhythms are called circadian rhythms (from the Latin words \u2018circa\u2019, meaning about, and \u2018dies\u2019, meaning a day). Circadian clocks have two main features: \u2022 They will persist with a period of about 24 hours in the absence of environmental cues. \u2022 They can synchronise to a 24-hour cue, such as the light\u2013dark cycle; this is called entrainment. The biological clock of mammals and of some other animals is found in a small area of the hypothalamus of the brain, called the suprachiasmatic nucleus. This sends impulses to a gland called the pineal gland, which secretes a hormone called melatonin during the night, which promotes sleepfulness and so controls the sleep\u2013 wake cycle. Because of this, if we did not have other cues to wake us and send us to sleep, we might expect to have a different sleep\u2013wake cycle in the summer compared to the winter. In a study of 26 people maintained in a constant environment for six days in summer and six days in winter, the results shown in table 5.1 were obtained. Clearly the shorter nights of summer have an effect \u2013 but not quite what one would expect. The subjects woke earlier in summer, but also went to bed earlier. However, the shorter nights did result in a reduction of 21 minutes of sleep. Changes in the light\u2013dark ratio can also control reproductive behaviour on an annual basis. Such rhythms are called circannual (yearly) rhythms. As the day length changes, so will the duration of melatonin secretion. This change in duration links reproductive behaviour in many animals to specific times of the year. Some animals are long-day (summer) breeders and others are short-day (winter) breeders. The point is that it is day length that triggers the changes. Many other animals show circannual rhythms in behaviours such as: \u2022 migration (for example, swallows) \u2022 hibernation (for example, hedgehogs) \u2022 coat growth (for example, arctic foxes) \u2022 camouflage colouring (for example, arctic foxes)",

Instinctive behaviours often involve a complex sequence of actions. A good example to illustrate this point is the spinning of a web by spiders. It involves many complex actions, yet the spider does not have to learn how to do it. It spins a perfect web the very first time \u2013 as well as every other time afterwards. Instinctive behaviours have the following characteristics: \u2022 they are common to all members of a species \u2022 they are fully functional the first time they are performed (they require no learning) \u2022 there is a key stimulus that triggers the behaviour \u2022 there is an innate releasing mechanism that links the stimulus to the response (this may be nervous or hormonal) \u2022 there is a fixed action pattern in response to the key stimulus that is always the same, and \u2022 instinctive behaviours are adaptive \u2013 they have been retained in the species by natural selection because they confer a survival advantage. The feeding behaviour of herring gulls discussed at the start of this chapter is an example of instinctive behaviour. The orange spot on the beak is the key stimulus and pecking it is the fixed action pattern. This is not much more complex than some reflex actions. However, aggression in sticklebacks (fish) involves more complex responses. Male sticklebacks are very territorial; they will attack any other male that invades their territory. In some famous experiments, the ethologist Niko Tinbergen was able to show that the key stimulus was the red belly of the entering male. The \u2018defending\u2019 male attacked any non-fish model that had red on its ventral (lower) surface. However, it turns out that the red belly \u2013 the key stimulus \u2013 provokes a very different fixed action pattern in female sticklebacks. They find it irresistible and it stimulates mating behaviour! There is some evidence that some fixed action patterns can be modified slightly by experience. In an investigation into nesting behaviour in lovebirds, two different species of lovebirds with different nesting behaviours were interbred.\n\u2022 Female Fischer\u2019s Lovebirds cut long strips of nesting material, which are carried individually to the nest. \u2022 Female Peach-faced Lovebirds cut short strips and carry several at a time by tucking them into their back feathers. Hybrid females from the crosses exhibited the following behaviours. In the first mating season they: \u2022 cut intermediate length strips \u2022 tried, but failed, to transport them by tucking into back feathers \u2022 learned to carry strips in their beaks In subsequent seasons they always carried the strips in their beaks, but never gave up all \u2018tucking\u2019 behaviour. Imprinting is another kind of instinctive behaviour in which the fixed action pattern is for newly born/hatched organisms to imprint on (or become attached to) the first thing they see that has certain general features (those of an adult of its species). In a famous experiment, Konrad Lorenz split a batch of goose eggs into two batches. One batch was hatched normally by the geese. The other batch was hatched by Lorenz in an incubator. He was the first moving thing they saw \u2026 There is a \u2018time window\u2019 for imprinting to take place. Generally, if it does not take place in the first two days after hatching, then the gosling will not imprint. This, too, may have survival value. If \u2018mother goose\u2019 hasn\u2019t appeared in the first two days, imprinting on and following the first moving object after that could be more dangerous than not imprinting at all. Many evolutionary psychologists believe that a similar pattern of behaviour is found in human infants. It is called attachment formation and involves the formation of a strong emotional bond between an infant and its primary caregiver \u2013 often, but not exclusively, the mother. This occurs in three stages: \u2022 0\u20132 months \u2013 pre-attachment; the infant prefers people to objects but does not really discriminate between different people \u2022 2\u20137 months \u2013 indiscriminate attachment; the infant begins to show a preference for familiar people, and \u2022 7 months onwards \u2013 true emotional attachment to one person initially, although multiple attachments often form soon afterwards. According to John Bowlby (who was influenced by the work of Lorenz and other ethologists) attachment formation in humans would also have survival value and natural selection could act to make this behaviour pattern widespread in the species.",

Unlike innate behaviours, learned behaviour patterns are rarely fully functional the first time they are performed. At the very simplest level of learning, trial and error brings about an improvement in the effectiveness of the behaviour pattern.

In this example, your sense of smell has demonstrated habituation. You have stopped responding to the odour even though it is still present.\nHabituation can occur at different levels in the nervous system. It can happen because:\n\u2022 sensory systems may stop, after a while, sending signals to the brain in response to a continuously present or often-repeated stimulus; this is sensory habituation\n\u2022 the brain still perceives the stimulus is still present, but has simply decided no longer to pay attention\nAn example of habituation to humans occurs in prairie dogs. Because they have several predators, they give alarm calls when large mammals, large birds or snakes approach them. This allows the group to retreat into their burrows. When populations of prairie dogs are located near areas regularly used by humans, the alarm call is not given when humans pass, despite being large mammals. This is an important example of habituation as the alarm response would waste the time and energy of the group when they could be foraging.",

These two forms of habituation have been interpreted as models of short- and long-term memory.\nResearch has also shown that the nerve network that brings about the response is altered as a result of habituation.\nNotice that habituation occurs when the stimulus is harmless \u2013 a gentle touch on the siphon of Aplysia, prairie dogs becoming habituated to the presence of humans who do them no harm, you becoming habituated to a smell which may be unpleasant, but is not harmful.",

It was discovered by the Russian physiologist Ivan Pavlov, who worked with dogs to develop this theory. The various stimuli and responses are:\nThe unconditioned stimulus (US) This \u2018unconditionally\u2019, naturally and automatically triggers a response. For example, when you smell a favourite food, you immediately feel very hungry. The smell of the food is the unconditioned stimulus.\nThe unconditioned response (UR) The unlearned response that occurs naturally to the unconditioned stimulus. In the \u2018feeling hungry\u2019 example, feeling hungry is the unconditioned response.\nThe conditioned stimulus (CS) This neutral stimulus does not initially produce the unconditioned response. But, after association with the unconditioned stimulus, it triggers the same response.\nThe conditioned response (CR) The conditioned response is the response to the previously neutral stimulus (which is the same as the unconditioned response to the unconditioned stimulus).\nPavlov\u2019s research involved the following phases:\n\u2022 He fed the dogs at regular intervals to establish a routine; as he fed them, they salivated: this is a natural unconditioned response to the (natural) unconditioned stimulus of food.\n\u2022 Then, as he fed them, he rang a bell; they continued to produce the same unconditioned response (salivation) as the food was presented and the bell was rung.\n\u2022 After a period, the dogs salivated when the bell was rung without food being presented; this is now a conditioned response to a conditioned stimulus.\nIt is possible to classically condition humans as a famous study called \u2018Little Albert\u2019 demonstrated.\n\u2018Little Albert\u2019 was an 11-month-old infant, who rarely showed fear of anything. He was not afraid of animals, including the white laboratory rat. He was, however, afraid of loud noises (US). Two psychologists (Watson and Rayner) used his fear of loud noises (UR) to condition Little Albert to fear the white laboratory rat. They showed Albert the rat and at the same time made a loud noise (they banged a steel pipe with a hammer). After only seven pairings of the rat and the loud noise, Little Albert began to cry and try to crawl away (CR) as soon as he saw the rat (CR), even though the rat was not linked with the loud noise on this occasion. He had been conditioned to fear the rat.\nIf the pairing of conditioned stimulus with the unconditioned stimulus is not maintained, then the conditioned response diminishes and eventually is lost. This is called extinction. Little Albert lost his fear of the white rat after a period of it no longer being paired with the loud noise.",

Operant conditioning can modify more complex, voluntary behaviours by the animal/ person learning to associate the behaviour with certain specific consequences.\nThe term \u2018operant conditioning\u2019 was first used by B F Skinner, a behaviourist psychologist who carried out a great deal of pioneering research in this area.\nSkinner identified three types of responses that he called operants that can follow behaviour:\n\u2022 Neutral operants: responses from the environment that neither increase nor decrease the probability of a behaviour being repeated.\n\u2022 Reinforcers: responses from the environment that increase the probability of a behaviour being repeated, reinforcers can be either positive or negative.\n\u2022 Punishers: responses from the environment that decrease the likelihood of a behaviour being repeated.\nSkinner carried out much of his research on rats and other animals using what is now called a Skinner box. One variant of the Skinner box is shown in figure 5.22.\nThe Skinner box has various signal stimuli that include:\n\u2022 different coloured lights\n\u2022 a speaker to deliver a sound stimulus\n\u2022 an electric grid in the floor to deliver a mild electric shock\nThere is also a lever that the animal can press, which is linked to the delivery of pellets of food. The animal can be conditioned in several ways, such as by:\n\u2022 simply learning that pressing the lever will result in food being delivered \u2013 the \u2018pressing action\u2019 is reinforced by the reward of food\n\u2022 only pressing the lever when either light is lit up, resulting in the reinforcement of food being delivered\n\u2022 only pressing the lever when one of the lights is lit; the other is linked to the electric shock system. The \u2018punishment\u2019 of the shock on pressing this light results in the behaviour being diminished or extincted\nWe can all think of examples of how our own behaviour has been affected by reinforcers and punishers. For example, many people start to smoke so that they will be accepted by a certain peer group. Acceptance by this peer group acts as a positive reinforcer for the smoking and, unfortunately, is often a much stronger influence than other advice and punishers.\nAnimal trainers use a technique called shaping, which is based on operant conditioning, to train animals to perform in specific ways. It is often not possible to reward the desired behaviour at the outset, because it doesn\u2019t exist. Trainers look for a natural behaviour that, if modified, could lead to the desired behaviour and reward this. They then reward a slight modification of this behaviour that is nearer to the desired behaviour, but not the natural behaviour itself. Each step",

Latent learning happens when the brain acquires knowledge at a certain time, without reinforcement, but does not use it until later, at a time when that knowledge is needed. An example of this could be: One teacher drives another to school every day. Then, on one day, the \u2018driver\u2019 is ill. The other teacher drives himself to school without getting lost. This is an example of latent learning. He learned the route to the school without reinforcement, but never had to use it until the usual driver was ill. Edward Tolman, a behaviourist psychologist, conducted an experiment with rats in 1938. He placed three groups of rats in a maze and observed how they behaved over a two-week period. \u2022 The rats in group 1 always received a food reward when they reached the end of the maze without wandering down dead ends; they soon did this regularly. \u2022 The rats in group 2 never received a food reward and seemed like they followed no particular path through the maze, although they did sometimes reach the end. \u2022 The rats in Group 3 were treated in a different way at different times of the experiment: \u2013 for the first 10 days of the experiment, like group 2 they received no food reward even if they did reach the end of the maze and behaved in a similar manner to group 2 \u2013 on the eleventh day, Tolman placed food in the maze, and \u2013 on the twelfth day, the rats from group 3 were doing as well as the rats from group 1, which had been rewarded with food from the very beginning of the test; it appears that they had learned to go to the end of the maze without reinforcement, but did not desire to until there was some reason (the food). The rats from group 3 used latent learning since they did not immediately display the same performance as the rats in group 1. In other experiments, Tolman was able to demonstrate that the rats were building a \u2018cognitive map\u2019 of the maze. This means that they were storing information, without reinforcement of the structure of the maze. In the maze shown in figure 5.23, the rats quickly learned that the shortest route to the end of the maze was path A. They also \u2018knew\u2019 that if: \u2022 path A was blocked at X, then the new shortest path was path B \u2022 path A was blocked at Y, the new shortest path was path C It is important to note that, although there was food at the end of the maze, this could not act as a reinforcer for the building of the cognitive map. It only gave a \u2018reason\u2019 to get to the end of the maze.",

The \u2018eureka\u2019 moment. Much of the pioneering research on insight learning was carried out by Wolfgang Kohler, working with chimpanzees. For the experiments, the chimpanzees were placed in an enclosed area. Kohler placed desirable \u2018lures\u2019 such as fruit outside the enclosure and out of their reach. He placed a variety of objects that could be used to obtain it inside the enclosure. The chimpanzees had to work out a way of using one or more of the objects to obtain the \u2018lure\u2019. They were more successful in this than Kohler had anticipated. The chimpanzees learned to use boxes to obtain bananas placed on the top of the enclosure. They dragged them under the banana and then climbed on them to reach the fruit. They became quite accomplished builders, piling box on box to erect structures with a height of four boxes. Some of the chimpanzees learned how to make or modify suitable tools from the materials they were given. One chimpanzee, Sultan, was particularly gifted in this. Sultan was given the problem of obtaining a banana far out of reach. There were two hollow bamboo sticks in his cage, but neither was long enough to rake in the lure. After many attempts to reach the banana with one stick or the other, he sat and looked at the sticks. Suddenly Sultan hit upon the solution. He pushed the thinner of the two sticks into the hollow inside of the thicker one and then drew the banana towards himself, his reach now enlarged by the length of two sticks. Eureka!",

It allows members of a species to recognise each other and prevents or reduces attempts at interbreeding between different species. Courtship may simply involve a few chemical, visual or auditory stimuli, or it may be a complex series of acts by two or more individuals using several methods of communication. Elaborate courtship rituals can also help to strengthen already established pair bonds. These may then last through the time it takes to rear the young and, in some cases, even longer. There are many different methods of communication that are used to attract a mate. These include: \u2022 the use of pheromones by some female insects to attract males from a distance \u2022 the use of touch by painted turtles \u2022 the courtship songs of frogs heard on spring nights in many different countries \u2022 the song of a humpback whale under the sea, which can be heard hundreds of miles away In most animals, courtship behaviour is innate and consists of a pre-programmed set of fixed action patterns in response to a key stimulus. Despite being innate, the fixed action patterns are often complex behaviours with the fixed action pattern in one animal (say the male) serving as the stimulus for another fixed action pattern in the other animal (the female). This interaction of fixed action patterns continues until courtship is successful or until one of the pair tires. Figure 5.26 shows the sequence of fixed action patterns that make up the courtship behaviour of zebra fish.

        "chunk_text": "Before we describe this kind of behaviour, we must make clear what we understand by territory. Most animal behavioural biologists would define territory as: Any space that an animal defends against intruders of the same species. Territorial behaviour is found in nearly every species of animal, even humans. Possessing territory gives the holder areas to forage for food and so increases the chances of attracting a mate. It also reduces vulnerability to predators. Animals that do not have a territory of their own may contest with the owner for a territory that is already occupied. Such contests are called conspecific (same species) conflicts. Territorial animals usually defend areas that contain one or more of: \u2022 a nest \u2022 a den, or mating site \u2022 sufficient food for themselves and their young Males are usually the territorial sex, but in some species (such as fiddler crabs) females maintain a territory also. When conspecific conflicts occur, they usually involve ritualistic displays and rarely involve the animals actually fighting. Residents of a territory are difficult to dislodge as they are often older and more experienced. Defence threat displays may be visual as in the colour of feathers or fur, auditory as in birdsong or the howls of gibbons or olfactory through the deposition of scent marks. Many territorial mammals use scent marking (containing pheromones) to signal the boundaries of their territories. The resident animal usually holds on to his (or her) territory only by expending considerable time and effort in its defence. Sunbirds, for example, can use up to 13 000 kilojoules per hour patrolling and defending their territory. This is more than the recommended daily energy intake for the average adult human male! Clearly, to expend that amount of energy, the territory must contain, at the very least, an abundance of food to support it. The Ethiopian wolf (Canis simensis) is a social animal; the wolves live and hunt in packs. As a result, they maintain a group territory by marking with urine (containing pheromones). All adult animals (male and female) contribute to this marking behaviour, particularly during patrols of the territory. Some of the subadult (younger) males occasionally mark but subadult females never mark. Direct encounters between neighbouring wolves at the borders were aggressive and involved repeated chases, with the larger group more likely to win.",

Fighting uses up a large amount of energy, and can result in injury or death. So, behaviour has evolved that makes fighting the \u2018last resort\u2019. Marking a territory usually \u2018warns off\u2019 intruders. Animals that do not mark territories use threats from one, or more, of vocalisations, smells and visual displays. The songs of birds and the loud calls of monkeys are warnings that carry for considerable distances, and warn intruders that they are approaching someone else\u2019s territory. If these warnings are ignored, and the intruder enters the territory, or two animals meet near the border of their adjacent territories, they usually threaten each other with visual displays. These displays often either: \u2022 exaggerate an animal\u2019s size by the fluffing up of feathers or fur, or \u2022 show off the animal\u2019s weapons. Also, the animals may go through all the motions of fighting without ever actually touching each other, a behaviour known as ritual fighting. Ritual fighting is more intense the further into an animal\u2019s territory it takes place. In this situation, the territory holder has \u2018nowhere to go\u2019 \u2013 he cannot retreat. If the encounter takes place nearer to the border, the ritual fighting becomes less intense and more fragmented because the territory holder has the option of retreating. This variation in the intensity of the display helps to define territorial boundaries, where the displays of neighbours are about equal in intensity, or where the tendency to attack and the tendency to retreat are about equally balanced. Actual fighting usually only happens in overcrowded conditions where resources are scarce. Serious injury can result, and old or sick animals may die, leading to a more balanced and biologically fit population. Fighting can occur when a young male animal challenges an older one for the territory, which may be \u2018home\u2019 to several females as well as being a foraging area. Older animals are more experienced, but, eventually, experience will give way to the strength of a younger animal and the territory holder will be displaced.

It is thought to have been selected for because it has survival value to the species as a whole. Social behaviour serves many purposes and is found in a wide variety of animals, including some invertebrates, fish, birds and mammals. Some of the benefits of social behaviour are that it allows animals to: \u2022 form stable groups in which intra-specific aggression is reduced, sometimes as a result of hierarchies being established \u2022 improve the effectiveness of reproduction and/or parenting through courtship behaviour (a kind of social behaviour) and pair-bond formation \u2022 forage more efficiently \u2013 especially if sources of food are localised.

Honeybees nest in large cavities such as hollowed-out trees or other enclosed spaces. They will use man-made beehives just as readily as a hollow tree trunk. Honey bees build vertical sheets of hexagonal honeycomb from wax secreted by glands in their abdomens, in which they store honey and pollen. An individual hexagon (a cell) can also be used as a home for a single developing bee larva. There are three different types or castes of bees in a nest. They are: \u2022 the queen \u2013 the only truly reproductively active female (1st caste) \u2022 workers \u2013 non-reproductively active females (2nd caste) \u2022 drones \u2013 reproductively active males (3rd caste) The queen secretes powerful pheromones within the nest that control the behaviour of the workers at different stages of their development and so help to maintain the social structure of the nest. She may also make aggressive attacks on maturing worker bees. If the queen does not produce these pheromones, or if she produces too few eggs, then the structure of the nest breaks down. She may be attacked by mature workers, one of whom will replace her. A honeybee colony may last for several years, with the male drones being driven out of the nest over winter to preserve resources for the workers and the queen. More drones will emerge the following spring. At the end of the colony cycle, the queen, the drones and most workers will die, leaving just a few large workers, who will assume the status of queens and, the following spring, fly away to establish their own colonies.",
