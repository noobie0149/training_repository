Bacteria cause disease by releasing toxins that affect cells locally or systemically and by invading and growing in tissues, causing physical damage; bacterial diseases like pneumonia, cholera, and pulmonary tuberculosis can be treated with antibiotics due to bacteria being true cells with metabolic systems. Viruses, which are not true cells, enter living cells to disrupt their metabolic systems and instruct them to produce more viruses, leading to diseases such as influenza, AIDS, measles, and the common cold; they cannot be treated with antibiotics. Fungi cause disease when their hyphae secrete enzymes that digest and absorb substances from tissues, causing physical damage; they can also secrete toxins or cause allergic reactions, as seen in athlete\u2019s foot and farmer\u2019s lung. Lastly, protozoa cause diseases like malaria and sleeping sickness through various mechanisms.",

Droplet infection, common in respiratory diseases, occurs when organisms are carried in airborne droplets from coughs or sneezes and inhaled, leading to illnesses like the common cold, 'flu, and pneumonia. Drinking contaminated water transmits diseases such as cholera and typhoid fever, where ingested organisms colonize the gut and are then excreted, re-entering water sources. Eating contaminated food, primarily causing bacterial food poisoning but also some viral infections, results in diseases like salmonellosis, typhoid fever, listeriosis, and botulism. Direct contact with an infected person or surface spreads skin infections like athlete\u2019s foot and ringworm. Sexual intercourse transmits organisms infecting sex organs, including candidiasis, syphilis, AIDS, and gonorrhoea, through direct body contact or bodily secretions. Blood-to-blood contact, such as sharing infected needles, transmits diseases like AIDS and hepatitis B. Finally, animal vectors like mosquitoes or tsetse flies spread diseases such as malaria and sleeping sickness through bites, while flies can transfer micro-organisms from faeces to food.",

Ammonifying bacteria, acting as decomposers, break down proteins from dead organisms and animal waste, releasing ammonium ions convertible to nitrates. Nitrifying bacteria, specifically Nitrosomonas and Nitrobacter, perform nitrification in a two-step process: Nitrosomonas oxidizes ammonia or ammonium ions to nitrites, and then Nitrobacter converts nitrites to nitrates, the most plant-usable form. Lastly, denitrifying bacteria, such as Pseudomonas, reduce nitrates back into nitrogen gas, returning it to the air and diminishing soil nitrogen.",

Hot deserts receive almost no precipitation, are hot, have poor soil, and feature sparse succulents and sagebrush, along with sparse insects, arachnids, reptiles, and birds. Cold deserts similarly have almost no precipitation and poor soil but are cold, supporting sparse microorganisms and some lichens, as well as polar bears and seals. Thorn forests, or scrub, experience dry summers and rainy winters, with hot summers and cool winters; their poor soil supports shrubs and some woodland, and they are home to drought- and fire-adapted animals. Tundras are dry and cold, characterized by permafrost, lichens, and mosses, and host migrating animals. Boreal forests, or Taiga, have adequate year-round precipitation, are cool, and feature poor, rocky soil with conifers, supporting many mammals, birds, insects, and arachnids. Temperate deciduous forests receive adequate precipitation, experience cool and warm seasons, possess fertile soil, and are dominated by deciduous trees, providing habitats for many mammals, birds, reptiles, and insects. Tropical montane forests have 8\u20139 wet months with consistently humid, warm air and fertile soil, supporting ferns, tree ferns, large deciduous trees, and epiphytes, along with many animals. Finally, tropical rainforests are very wet and always warm, with poor, thin soil, abundant plants, and common epiphytes, supporting a high diversity of animals.",

Marine biomes include oceanic pelagic zones, which have high salt content, moving water, and are the light-penetrating regions of the ocean, supporting many fish, mammals, and plankton. Oceanic abyssal zones also have high salt content but less water movement, are the deep ocean regions without light, and are home to angler fish and sulfur bacteria at vents. Coral reefs are high in salt, have moving water, are the most diverse marine habitats with strata similar to rainforests, and host corals, many fish, and seaweeds. Estuarine biomes have an intermediate salt content and extreme water movement due to mixing saltwater and freshwater, creating a unique habitat for shore birds, fish, crabs, mangroves, kelps, and sea grass. Freshwater biomes include ponds and lakes, which contain freshwater, have standing water that is stratified as the top layer absorbs more heat and light, and support large numbers of plankton, plants, and animals in their upper layers. Streams and rivers contain freshwater, have moving and highly oxygenated water, and are home to algae, plankton, plants, and fish. Lastly, wetlands are freshwater biomes with standing, very nutrient-rich water, supporting the highest diversity of plants and animals among all aquatic biomes.",

Predation, including that by herbivores on plants, effectively increases mortality and consequently reduces population numbers. Widespread disease also increases mortality, thereby slowing population growth. Intra-specific competition, which occurs among members of the same species, can reduce population growth in two main ways: either by decreasing resources for the entire population, thus reducing overall fertility, or by leading to the death of less effective competitors as others reproduce, still resulting in reduced growth. For inter-specific competition between different species, while the competitive exclusion principle suggests two species cannot occupy the same niche, outcomes can vary: one species may outcompete the other leading to its extinction, both species may experience a reduction due to near-equal resource harvesting and increased intra-specific competition, or the species may coexist.",

For instance, on day 7, the mean height ranged from 8.5 cm for 2 seeds to 4.8 cm for 32 seeds. By day 35, plants from 2 seeds reached 27.4 cm, 4 seeds reached 22.5 cm, 8 seeds reached 17.4 cm, 16 seeds reached 16.3 cm, and 32 seeds reached 15.2 cm.

For survival, Lamarck's theory suggests new features develop to ensure survival, whereas Darwin's theory emphasizes that the environment selects for beneficial traits and against disadvantageous ones. In terms of inheritance, Lamarck believed traits acquired during an individual's lifetime are passed to offspring, contrasting with Darwin's view that individuals with advantageous variations survive in greater numbers and pass these traits to their offspring.
