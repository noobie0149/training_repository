        "chunk_text": "Welcome to the study of biology! Biology is the study of life and living organisms. All around you there are many different types of plants, animals and other living organisms. They depend on each other and on the environment where they live. Biologists study both the outer appearance and the internal workings of living things. They study how living organisms interact and where human beings fit into the living world. All of our biological knowledge comes to us by the work of biologists, scientists who study living organisms. Biology, like all the sciences, moves forward most of the time in small, steady steps. One biologist comes up with an idea. Another carries out more experiments, which either support the new idea or suggest it is wrong. Then more biologists join in until eventually a new idea, or hypothesis, is accepted. Like all scientists, biologists publish their new work (called research) in special magazines called journals. Before an idea is published in a journal, several other well-known biologists have to read it and check that the research has been done to a high standard. This process is called peer review. Sometimes biology takes a great leap forward, when a very gifted biologist comes along with a big new idea! If you think you would like to be such a biologist, start right now by observing living things around you. Here in Ethiopia we have some very renowned biologists. Their work is known and important not just here in Ethiopia but around the world. Here are some of their biographies.",

        "chunk_text": "Schistosomiasis (also known as bilharziasis) is a common parasitic disease. It affects 200\u2013300 million people in Africa (including Ethiopia), South America, Asia and parts of the Caribbean. It is caused by parasitic flatworms which spend part of their lifecycle in freshwater snails and part in humans. Anyone washing, working or playing in shallow fresh water is at risk. Once inside a person, the parasites mature and produce eggs which are passed out in the urine and faeces. They also infest the blood vessels, liver, kidneys, bladder and other organs. The body sets up an immune reaction and an infected person can become weakened and ill for many years. Some of the most important work in finding a way of controlling this parasite, which is effective but does not cost too much, was carried out by Dr Aklilu Lemma, one of Ethiopia\u2019s most renowned biologists. Dr Aklilu began his work in 1964, when he was investigating the freshwater snails that carry the schistosomiasis parasite around Adwa in northern Ethiopia. He saw women washing clothes in the water and he noticed that downstream of the washing party there were more dead snails than anywhere else he had collected. The women were using the soapberry, Endod (Phytolacca dodecandra), to make washing suds. Dr Aklilu collected some live snails from above the washing party and asked one of the women to give him some of her Endod suds. Not long after the suds were put in the snail container, the snails all died. This was the start of years of work for Dr Aklilu. Back in the laboratory he showed that if the Endod berries were dried, crushed and diluted in water they would kill snails at very low concentrations. Other scientists carried out similar investigations and got the same results. If the freshwater snails can be controlled, the spread of schistosomiasis can be greatly reduced. The World Health Organisation recommended a chemical molluscicide (i.e. a compound that kills molluscs including snails) but it was extremely expensive. Endod works well, it is cheap, it is well known by local people who are likely to use it and it is environmentally friendly as it breaks down naturally within about two days. Dr Aklilu Lemma worked for many years to convince scientists all around the world that his ideas would work. Trials using locally collected Endod showed that using the molluscicide worked. Before the water was treated, 50% of children 1\u20136 years old were infected. After treatment only 7% were infected by the flatworm. Dr Aklilu\u2019s results were published in journals around the world. He found the best species of the soapberry plant and developed programmes for local communities to treat their own water. Eventually people were convinced and the use of Endod-based molluscicides is spreading throughout Africa and beyond. Hopefully a combination of Endod water treatment to kill the snails, improved hygiene, clean water wells and medicine for affected people will mean that Ethiopia can be free of this terrible disease. If we succeed it will be largely due to the work of Dr Aklilu Lemma. He has been honoured and recognised in many different ways both in Ethiopia and around the world for his work.",

During the 1990s Dr Tewolde Berhan was involved in negotiations at the various biodiversity-related meetings, including the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) and the Food and Agriculture Organization. Having built a strong and able team of African negotiators, he managed to help achieve progressive, unified policies for Africa, such as recognition of community rights. Dr Tewolde Berhan was instrumental in securing recommendations from the Organisation of African Unity (OAU) encouraging African countries to develop and implement community rights, a common position on Trade Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights, and a clear stance against patents on living materials. He also helped to draft the OAU model legislation for community rights, which is now used across Africa. In January 2000 Dr Tewolde Berhan acted as chief negotiator on biosafety for the Like-Minded Group, made up of most of the G77 countries, in Montreal. Here he was central to achieving an outcome protecting biosafety and biodiversity and respecting community rights, against strong US-led representations. Dr Tewolde Berhan also won the United Nations top environmental prize, Champions of the Earth, in 2006.",

Within a year 90% of the domestic cattle plus many wild animals such as buffalo, giraffe and antelope died. As a result 30\u201360% of the people starved. In the 1980s rinderpest became a major problem again. Professor Tilahun worked to develop a vaccine using genetic engineering. He was very successful \u2013 his vaccine doesn\u2019t need refrigeration, it is easily scratched onto the animal\u2019s neck or abdomen so cattle don\u2019t need injections from vets and it can be made relatively cheaply in large quantities. By 1997 the vaccine was ready for use across Africa, including his own country Ethiopia. Now he is working on using similar methods to develop an effective vaccine against HIV/AIDS, which is affecting people all around the world including millions of Africans. Professor Tilahun has been given many international awards and honours over the years. He is also very active in encouraging young scientists and establishing the highest quality research establishments here in Africa.",

        "chunk_text": "The reason microscopes are so useful is because they magnify things, making them look bigger. Magnification means increasing the size of an object. The best light microscopes will magnify up to around 2000 times. Light microscopes have given us a lot of information about the structure of cells, but in the last 50 years or so we have also been able to use electron microscopes. An electron microscope can give you a magnification of around 2 000 000 times. Using electron microscopes makes it possible for us to learn a lot more about cells and the ways in which they become specialised for particular functions. The biggest problem with the light microscope is the limited detail it can show. There is a minimum distance between two objects for them to be seen clearly as separate. If they are closer together than this they are seen as one thing. This distance is known as the limit of resolution. Resolution is the ability to distinguish between two separate points and it is the resolving power of a microscope that affects how much detail it can show. The greater the resolving power of the microscope, the more detail it can show. For the optical light microscope the limit of resolution is approximately 200 nanometres (1 nm = 1 \u00d7 10\u20139 m). In comparison, the human eye can only resolve down to about 0.1 mm (1 mm = 1 \u00d7 10\u20132 m) (see figure 2.2). Objects closer than 0.1 mm are seen as one by human eyes. The magnification we can get with a light microscope is limited by the resolving power possible using the wavelength of light. To see more detail clearly we need an electron microscope where an electron beam is used to make the image. As the wavelength gets smaller, the resolving power is increased. An electron microscope has a resolving power around a thousand times better than a light microscope, about 0.3 nm. Objects that are 0.3 nm apart can be seen as separate by an electron microscope, demonstrating that the resolving power of an electron microscope is greater than that of a light microscope.",

Light microscopes can also be used without electricity, which means they can be used anywhere in the world. Light microscopes are relatively small and not very heavy, so they can be moved around easily. They are quite delicate so they need to be protected, but with care biologists can even take light microscopes out into the field with them to do their research. The biggest disadvantage of light microscopes is that their resolving power is limited by the wavelength of light. As you saw earlier, this limits their powers of magnification.

        "chunk_text": "Cells were first seen over 300 years ago. In 1665, the English scientist Robert Hooke designed and put together one of the first working optical microscopes. He examined many different things including thin sections of cork. Hooke saw that these sections were made up of many tiny, regular compartments, which he called cells. It took many years of further work for the importance of cells to be recognised. In 1839 Matthias Schleiden and Theodore Schwann introduced an idea known as the cell theory. The cell theory states that cells are the basic units of life and by the 1840s this idea was accepted by most biologists. All living organisms have certain characteristics, which they carry out regardless of whether they have one cell or millions. When we look at cells we can see how all of these functions are carried out. The seven life processes that are common to most living organisms are: \u2022 Nutrition \u2013 all living organisms need food to provide them with the energy used by their cells. Plants make their own food by photosynthesis, whereas animals eat other organisms. \u2022 Respiration \u2013 the process by which living organisms get the energy from their food. \u2022 Excretion \u2013 getting rid of the waste products produced by the cells. \u2022 Growth \u2013 living organisms get bigger. They increase in both size and mass, using chemicals from their food to build new material. \u2022 Irritability \u2013 all living organisms are sensitive to changes in their surroundings. \u2022 Movement \u2013 all living organisms need to move to get near to things they need or away from problems. Animals move using muscles, plants move more slowly using growth. \u2022 Reproduction \u2013 producing offspring is vital to the long-term survival of any type of living organism.",

This has led scientists to develop a picture of the basic structure of an unspecialised animal cell and an unspecialised green plant cell.

It also contains the instructions for making new cells or new organisms in the form of long threads known as chromosomes. This is the genetic material. You will find out more about this in Grade 10. \u2022 The cytoplasm is a liquid gel in which most of the chemical reactions needed for life take place. About 70% of the cytoplasm of a cell is actually water! The cytoplasm contains all the other organelles of the cell where most of the chemical reactions take place. \u2022 The cell membrane forms a barrier like a very thin \u2018skin\u2019 around the outside of the cell. The membrane controls the passage of substances such as carbon dioxide, oxygen and water in and out of the cell. Because it lets some substances through but not others it is known as selectively permeable. \u2022 The mitochondria (singular: mitochondrion) are the powerhouse of the cell.

Cell chemistry works because each reaction is controlled by an enzyme, a protein designed to control the rate of a very specific reaction and ensure that it takes place without becoming mixed up with any other reaction. What is more, the enzymes involved in different chemical processes are usually found in different parts of the cell. So, for example, most of the enzymes controlling the reactions of respiration are found in the mitochondria.

The cell wall is made mainly of a carbohydrate called cellulose, which strengthens the cell and gives it support. It is found outside the cell membrane.

Many (but not all) plant cells also have other features. \u2022 Chloroplasts are found in all of the green parts of the plant.

But in multicellular organisms like human beings, most cells become specialised \u2013 that is, they are adapted to carry out a particular function in your body. When an egg and a sperm combine to form an embryo, a single cell is formed. This cell divides many times (you will learn more about this in Grade 10) to form a mass of similar undifferentiated cells. Each of these cells (known as embryonic stem cells) carries all of the genetic information of the individual. As the embryo develops, the cells become differentiated \u2013 they specialise to carry out a particular function. For example, some cells differentiate to become red blood cells and carry oxygen, some become muscle cells and others become neurones (nerve cells). This differentiation takes place as some of the genetic material (genes) in the nucleus of the cells is switched on and others are switched off. Scientists are still not quite sure what causes these changes to take place, but it seems to be at least partly down to the position of the cells in the embryo itself. The specialised cells which form as cells differentiate are often grouped together to form a tissue \u2013 for example in humans connective tissue joins bits of the body together, while nervous tissue carries information around the body and muscle tissue contracts to move the body about. In many living organisms, including people, there is another level of organisation. Several different tissues work together to do different jobs and form an organ such as the heart, the kidneys or the lungs. In turn different organs are combined in organ systems to carry out major functions in the body such as transporting the blood or reproduction. Examples include the cardiovascular system (the heart, lungs and blood vessels) and the digestive system.",

Epithelial cells have many different functions, and their basic structure may be adapted to make them more efficient at their job.

Epithelial cells often allow the diffusion of materials from one area of your body to another \u2013 they line the air sacs (alveoli) of your lungs, and the gut wall as well as many glands which secrete hormones or enzymes. Epithelial cells may be flattened, thin columns or have tiny, hair-like projections known as microvilli on them to increase the surface area of the cell. This is seen in places like the gut, where diffusion is very important. Some epithelial cells found in the respiratory and the reproductive systems have small hair-like cilia, which move and beat and can be used to move substances through a tube.

Egg cells have a large nucleus containing genetic information from the woman. They have a protective outer coat to make sure only one sperm gets through to fertilise the egg, and a store of food in the cytoplasm for the developing embryo. In humans, this food store is quite small, but in animals such as birds it is very large \u2013 it forms the yolk of the egg. A small number of relatively large egg cells are released by the ovaries over a woman\u2019s reproductive life. If you are male, once you have gone through puberty your body will produce millions of male sex cells known as sperm. Like the egg cells, sperm have only half the chromosome number of normal body cells. Sperm cells are usually released a long way from the egg they are going to fertilise. They need to move through the female reproductive system to reach an egg. Then they need to be able to break into the egg. They have several adaptations to make all this possible. Sperm have long tails containing muscle-like proteins so they can swim towards the egg. The middle section of a sperm is full of mitochondria which provide the energy for the tail to work. They have a special sac known as the acrosome, which stores digestive enzymes used for breaking down the outer layers of the egg.

Diffusion is the net (overall) movement of particles from an area of high concentration to an area of lower concentration. Concentration is a way of measuring how much (how many particles) of a substance is in one place. Diffusion takes place because of the random movements of the particles of a gas or of a substance in solution in water. All the particles are moving and bumping into each other and this moves them all around. Although the molecules are moving in both directions, there are more particles moving in the area of high concentration, and so the net (overall) movement is away from the area of high concentration towards the area of low concentration. Imagine an empty classroom containing a group of boys and a group of girls. If everyone closes their eyes and moves around briskly but randomly, people will bump into each other and scatter until the room contains a mixture of boys and girls.

However, when a substance is moving from a higher concentration to one which is just a bit lower, the movement towards the less concentrated area will appear to be quite small. This is because although some particles move into the area of lower concentration by random movement, at the same time other identical particles are leaving that area by random movement. the overall or net movement = particles moving in \u2013 particles moving out In general the bigger the difference in concentration the faster the rate of diffusion will be. This difference between two areas of concentration is called the concentration gradient and the bigger the difference the steeper the gradient will be. Concentration isn\u2019t the only thing that affects the rate of diffusion. An increase in temperature means the particles in a gas or a solution move more quickly. This in turn means diffusion will take place more rapidly as the random movement of the particles speeds up.

Simple sugars like glucose and amino acids from the breakdown of proteins in your gut can also pass through your cell membranes by diffusion. Because diffusion can be a relatively slow process, individual cells may be adapted to make diffusion easier and more rapid. As movement of substances into and out of cells takes place across the cell membrane, the most common adaptation is to increase the surface area of the cell membrane over which diffusion occurs. Only so many particles of a substance such as oxygen can diffuse over a given surface area, so increasing the surface area means there is more room for diffusion to take place. By folding up the membrane of a cell the area over which diffusion can take place is greatly increased and so the amount of substance moved by diffusion is also greatly increased.

        "chunk_text": "Diffusion takes place where particles can spread freely from one place to another. However, the solutions inside a cell are separated from those outside the cell by the cell membrane, which does not let all types of particles through. Only the smallest particles can pass through freely. Because the membrane only lets some types of particles through, it is known as partially permeable. Partially permeable cell membranes allow water to move across them. It is important to remember that a dilute solution of (for example) sugar contains a high concentration of water (the solvent) and a low concentration of sugar (the solute). A concentrated sugar solution contains a relatively low concentration of water and a high concentration of sugar. Osmosis is a special type of diffusion where only water moves across a partially permeable membrane, from an area of high concentration of water to an area of lower concentration of water. A cell is basically a solution inside a partially permeable bag (the cell membrane). The cell contents contain a fairly concentrated solution of salts and sugars. Water moves from a high concentration of water particles (a dilute solution) to a less concentrated solution of water particles (a concentrated solution) across the membrane of the cell. The sugars and salts cannot cross the membrane. In other words, osmosis takes place. Take care when you define osmosis. Make it clear that it is only water that is moving across the membrane, and get your concentrations right! The internal concentration of your cells needs to stay the same all the time for the reactions of life to take place. Yet animal and plant cells are bathed in liquid which can be at very different concentrations to the inside of the cells. This can make water move into or out of the cells by osmosis. So osmosis is very important for all living organisms, including human beings. Cell membranes aren\u2019t the only partially permeable membranes. There are artificial ones too, and these can be used to make a model cell (see the specimen investigation below). By changing the concentration of the solutions inside and outside your model cell, you can see exactly why osmosis is so important in living organisms \u2013 and why it is so critical if things go wrong! There are a number of ways in which you can show how osmosis takes place in living cells. One is described for you here and written out as a specimen investigation. Other ways of investigating osmosis in cells are presented for you to try. If the concentration of the solutions on both sides of a cell membrane are the same they are isotonic. If the concentration of the solution on the outside of the cell membrane is higher than the concentration of the solution inside the cell it is hypertonic. If the concentration of the solution on the outside of the cell membrane is lower than the concentration of the solution inside the cell it is hypotonic.",

The external solution becomes hypertonic and water will leave the cell by osmosis, restoring the balance. However osmosis can also cause some very serious problems in animal cells. If the solution outside the cell is much more dilute than the cell contents (hypotonic) then water will move into the cell by osmosis, diluting the cytoplasm. The cell will swell and may eventually burst. On the other hand, if the solution outside the cell is much more concentrated than the cell contents (hypertonic) then water will move out of the cell by osmosis, the cytoplasm will become too concentrated and the cell will shrivel up.

The pressure builds up until no more water can enter the cell, which is hard and rigid. This swollen state is called turgor. It keeps the leaves and stems of the plant rigid and firm. So for plants it is important that the fluid surrounding the cells always has a higher concentration of water (it is a more dilute solution of chemicals or hypotonic) than the cytoplasm of the cells, to keep osmosis working in the right direction. To understand the difference between animal and plant cells when it comes to water moving in by osmosis, imagine blowing up a balloon. As more and more water moves in the balloon gets bigger and bigger and eventually bursts. This models an animal cell placed in pure water or a very dilute solution of salts. Now imagine a balloon sealed into a cardboard box. As the balloon inflates it fills the box and then presses out against the box walls. Eventually you simply cannot force any more air into the balloon. The box feels very rigid and the balloon does not burst. This models a plant cell placed in pure water or a very dilute solution of salts. If the surrounding fluid becomes more concentrated than the contents of the plant cells (hypertonic), then water will leave the cells by osmosis. The vacuole shrinks and the cell becomes much less rigid \u2013 it is flaccid. If water continues to leave the cell by osmosis, eventually the cytoplasm pulls away from the cell walls and the cell goes into a state known as plasmolysis. As you have seen, in normal conditions water moves into plant cells by osmosis and keeps them rigid. This in turn helps to keep the plant upright. But if conditions are very dry, the plant cannot take enough water up through the roots from the soil. The cells are no longer rigid and the plant wilts. Many of the chemical reactions slow down and so the plant survives until more water is available.

Diffusion is the passive movement of substances and it depends on a concentration gradient in the right direction to work. Osmosis depends on a concentration gradient of water and a partially permeable membrane. Only water moves in osmosis. However, sometimes the substances needed by your body have to be moved against a concentration gradient, or across a partially permeable membrane, or both. The only way you can do this is to use energy produced by respiration. The process is known as active transport. Active transport allows cells to move substances from an area of low concentration to an area of high concentration, completely against the concentration gradient. As a result the cells can absorb ions from very dilute solutions. It also makes it possible for them to move substances like sugars and ions from one place to another through the cell membranes. It takes energy for the active transport system shown in figure 2.33 to carry a molecule across the membrane and then return to its original position. That energy comes from cellular respiration. Scientists have shown in a number of different cells that the rate of respiration and the rate of active transport are closely linked. In other words, if a cell is making lots of energy, it can carry out lots of active transport. Cells like root hair cells and your gut lining cells, which are involved in a lot of active transport, usually have lots of mitochondria to provide the energy they need.",

        "chunk_text": "Active transport is widely used in cells. There are some situations where it is particularly important. For example, the mineral ions in the soil are usually found in very dilute solutions \u2013 more dilute than the solution within the plant cells. By using active transport plants can absorb these mineral ions needed for making proteins and other important chemicals from the soil, even though it is against a concentration gradient. Glucose is always moved out of your gut and kidney tubules into your blood, even when it is against a large concentration gradient, so this relies on active transport. The cells of all living organisms contain sodium chloride and other chemicals in solution. This means they can always be prone to water moving into them by osmosis. If they are immersed in a solution with a lower concentration of salts than the body cells they will tend to gain water. If in a more concentrated solution, water is lost. Either way can spell disaster. Here are just a few of the different ways in which living organisms attempt \u2013 largely successfully \u2013 to beat osmosis! Active transport is usually an important part of the solution. Fish that live in fresh water have a real problem. They need a constant flow of water over their gills to get the oxygen they need for respiration. But water moves into their gill cells and blood by osmosis at the same time. Like all vertebrates, fish have kidneys which play a big part in osmoregulation. So freshwater fish produce huge amounts of very dilute urine, which gets rid of the excess water which gets into their bodies. They also have special salt absorbing glands which use active transport to move salt against the concentration gradient from the water into the fish \u2013 rather like the situation in plant root cells. Some marine birds and reptiles \u2013 such as flamingos and green turtles \u2013 have the opposite problem. They take in a great deal of salt in the sea water they drink, and their kidneys cannot get rid of it all. The solution is special salt glands which are usually found near the eyes and nostrils. Sodium ions are moved out of the body into the salt glands which then produce a very strong salt solution \u2013 up to six times more salty than their urine! The sodium ions have to be moved against a very big concentration gradient, and so active transport is involved in the survival of these marine creatures. It isn\u2019t just animals that have this problem. Mangrove swamps can only survive in the salty water where they grow because many of the species of mangroves have salt glands in the leaves. They remove the excess salt that gets into their systems by active transport through these glands.",

In fact the definition of a micro-organism is an organism that can only be seen with the aid of a microscope. Many of these micro-organisms are very important. Some play a major role in decay and the recycling of nutrients in the environment. Many micro-organisms are very useful to us and are used in making foods, such as injera, ergoo and ayib, and in producing alcoholic drinks, such as beer, wine and tej. With the arrival of new technologies like genetic engineering, micro-organisms are becoming more useful all the time. However, other micro-organisms cause disease in plants, animals and humans, which you will study in more detail in sections 4.2 and 4.3 of this book. Bacteria are single-celled organisms. They are much smaller than the smallest animal and plant cells. A bacterial cell has many similarities to animal and plant cells. It is made up of cytoplasm surrounded by a membrane and a cell wall. Inside the bacterial cell is the genetic material, but this is not contained in a nucleus. The bacterial cell wall differs from a plant cell wall because it is not made of cellulose. Some bacteria have additional features like flagella to help them move, or protective slime capsules. Bacteria also come in a variety of different shapes and sizes. Some are rod-shaped, some are round, some are comma-shaped and some characteristic basic structure. are spirals. Whilst some bacteria cause disease, many are harmless and some are actively useful to people. In fact you contain millions of bacteria, which live both on your skin and inside your body. Viruses are even smaller than bacteria. They usually have regular geometric shapes, and they are made up of a protein coat surrounding genetic material containing relatively few genes. They do not carry out any of the functions of normal living organisms except reproduction, and they can only reproduce by taking over another living cell. As far as we know, all naturally occurring viruses cause disease. Some of the micro-organisms that are most useful to people are moulds and yeasts. These are both fungi \u2013 living organisms which obtain their food from other dead or living organisms. Both moulds and yeast are extremely important as decomposers, breaking down animal and plant material and returning nutrients to the environment. Yeasts are single-celled organisms. Each yeast cell has a nucleus, cytoplasm and a membrane surrounded by a cell wall. The main way in which yeasts reproduce is by asexual budding \u2013 splitting to form new yeast cells. Moulds are rather different. They are made up of minute, thread-like structures called hyphae. The hyphae are not made up of individual cells \u2013 they are tubes consisting of a cell wall containing cytoplasm and lots of nuclei. Moulds, like yeasts, generally reproduce asexually but they do it by producing fruiting bodies containing spores.",

For many thousands of years people did not understand the cause of disease and thought that illness was a sign of anger by their God, or that it was the result of a curse. A look back in time can help us understand how people began to understand the real causes of disease, and how difficult it has been to help people understand this. In the 17th century a Dutchman, Anton van Leeuwenhoek, designed the first microscope. Robert Koch improved microscopes so much in the 19th century that people could see the tiny organisms which we now know are bacteria clearly for the first time. It was the work of the Frenchman Louis Pasteur in the later part of the 19th century which finally resulted in the widespread acceptance of the germ theory of disease. To begin with Pasteur showed that the fermentation reactions which are used to make beer and wine are the result of the action of micro-organisms on sugar. At that time many people believed that living things could arise from non-living things spontaneously. This was called spontaneous generation. Pasteur was convinced that any growths that appeared \u2013 for example, mould on food as it decayed \u2013 came from microscopic organisms already present in the air. First he showed that the theory of spontaneous generation was wrong. Then he showed that if he boiled broth and sealed the container, the broth would stay clear until he introduced material which had been exposed to the air. At this point micro-organisms grew and the broth turned cloudy. Finally he designed some experiments which showed this happening. Pasteur went on to identify the micro-organisms that caused a number of diseases in people and animals, including anthrax, rabies and diphtheria. He found ways of weakening or killing the microbes and made vaccines against the diseases. Pasteur\u2019s work showed everyone that infectious diseases are caused by micro-organisms.",

Other white blood cells (the phagocytes) then engulf and digest the disabled pathogens. However, in the meantime you may well suffer from the symptoms of disease. Once you have had a disease, your immune system \u2018remembers\u2019 the antigen and the right antibody to deal with it. If you meet the pathogen again, your white blood cells will produce antibodies immediately. The pathogen will be destroyed before it can cause symptoms of disease. You are immune to the illness.

However, there are some pathogens \u2013 such as the virus which causes HIV/AIDS \u2013 which your body simply cannot deal with.

Sterilisation is the killing of all micro-organisms in a material or on the surface of an object, making it safe to handle without fear of contamination. A surface or object is either sterile (it contains no micro-organisms) or it is not. There are no shades of grey in-between! There are a number of different ways we can sterilise things.

        "chunk_text": "Heat is a highly efficient means of sterilisation provided that the material to be sterilised is heat resistant. There are different ways of using heat to control micro-organisms \u2013 some of them give you a completely sterile environment and others simply reduce the numbers of micro-organisms substantially. \u2022 The simplest and best known method of sterilising thing, using heat involves boiling. The objects are placed in boiling water (at 100 \u00b0C) and kept there for some time. Ten minutes will kill most cells, but some viruses and bacteria (hepatitis viruses, Clostridium bacteria) take several hours of boiling to kill them. \u2022 Autoclaving: Normally water boils at 100 \u00b0C, but under pressure it boils at much higher temperatures. This is the principle used in autoclaving, the method most commonly used to sterilise materials that are not damaged by heat. An autoclave is very similar to a pressure cooker, which might be used in your kitchen at home to speed up the cooking of vegetables. The autoclave is used at 15 pounds per square inch of pressure, which raises the boiling point of water to 121 \u00b0C. 15\u201345 minutes of \u2018cooking\u2019 at these temperatures is enough to kill all micro-organisms and sterilise the equipment. \u2022 Ultra high temperature (UHT) is a way of treating food to kill all the micro-organisms on it. The temperatures used range from around 135 \u00b0C to 150 \u00b0C. The food is only heated to these extreme temperatures for 2\u20136 seconds, but that is long enough to kill any micro-organisms present and completely sterilise it. Because UHT treatment sterilises food, it not only gets rid of any disease-causing micro-organisms but also destroys the organisms that cause food to go bad. As a result, UHT food or milk will last for years if no air is allowed to get to it. \u2022 Pasteurisation: This is another technique widely used to treat milk, beer and other foodstuffs and make them safe to take into your body. Pasteurisation is not strictly speaking a method of sterilisation, because it does not kill all the micro-organisms in the food. To pasteurise food it is heated to either 71.6 \u00b0C for at least 15 seconds or 62.9 \u00b0C for 30 minutes. Either way, pathogens and most of the micro-organisms that make your food go bad are destroyed, so the food is much safer to eat and lasts longer. However, because it is not sterile, it will eventually go bad. \u2022 Dry heat, over a long time, kills all micro-organisms. Special ovens used in microbiology (the study of micro-organisms) use temperatures of 171 \u00b0C for an hour, or 160 \u00b0C for two hours, etc. The lower the temperature, the longer the time taken to sterilise things. They are used to sterilise scientific equipment. Incineration \u2013 burning substances at high temperatures in the air \u2013 also kills micro-organisms. You will use this technique to sterilise your inoculation loops in your practical work with bacteria.",

However, there are other very effective ways of controlling micro-organisms that we can use. Possible pathogens can be attacked chemically in a number of ways. For example, antiseptics and disinfectants kill micro-organisms on the skin and in the environment around us, reducing the spread of disease and the infection of wounds. A disinfectant is a chemical or physical agent that is applied to an inanimate object to kill micro-organisms. In other words, it is used on floors and surfaces, not on people! Disinfection means reducing the number of living micro-organisms present in a sample. The ideal disinfectant should have the following characteristics: \u2022 fast acting \u2022 effective against all types of infectious agents without destroying tissues or acting as a poison on the person using it \u2022 able to easily penetrate material to be disinfected without damaging or discolouring it \u2022 easy to prepare and stable on exposure to heat, light or other environmental factors \u2022 not unpleasant to work with, either in terms of its smell or its feel Bleach and calcium hypochlorite are common and widely used disinfectants. Dilute bleach and calcium hypochlorite can be used to disinfect our drinking water in Ethiopia, and household bleach can be used to keep sinks, toilets, milk containers and surfaces germ-free. Antiseptics are chemical agents that are applied to living tissue to kill micro-organisms \u2013 disinfectants for the skin, in fact! Think back to when you last cut yourself. The cut may have become infected. An open cut is an invitation to micro-organisms as they have easy access to the inside of your body. An antiseptic will kill all the micro-organisms on your skin and over the cut, preventing infection from getting into your tissues. Antiseptics often sting your skin \u2013 this is because they not only kill bacteria, they also damage human tissue slightly.",

To culture micro-organisms you must provide them with all they need. This usually involves providing a culture medium containing carbohydrate to act as an energy source, along with various mineral ions and in some cases extra protein and vitamins. The nutrients are often contained in an agar medium \u2013 agar is a substance which dissolves in hot water and sets to form a jelly. You pour hot agar containing all the necessary nutrients into a petri dish and leave it to cool and set before you add any micro-organisms. The other way to provide nutrients for growing micro-organisms is as a broth in a culture flask. Whichever way you do it, warmth and oxygen usually need to be provided as well. If you give bacteria the right conditions they can grow and divide very rapidly \u2013 which is why it is relatively easy to culture them in the lab. You have to take great care when you culture micro-organisms. Even when the micro-organisms you want to grow are completely harmless, there is always the risk that a mutation (you will learn more about this in Grade 10) may take place, resulting in a new and dangerous pathogen. Also your culture may be contaminated by disease-causing pathogens that are present in the air, soil or water around you.

        "chunk_text": "One way in which scientists identify bacteria is by staining them so they show up more clearly. A simple stain, e.g. crystal violet, will stain all bacteria purple. This makes it easier to see what shape they are. Some stains are used to identify particular types of bacteria. For example, if other chemicals are added to the simple crystal violet stain it gives a Gram stain. Different types of bacteria have different cell walls which take up the stains differently. There are four stages to making a Gram stain: \u2022 Firstly you stain all the bacteria on the slide with crystal violet, the primary stain \u2013 see activity 4.2. \u2022 Then you use Gram\u2019s iodine as a mordant and leave it on the slide for 1 minute. This combines with the crystal violet in the cell to form a violet\u2013iodine complex. \u2022 Without washing off the Gram\u2019s iodine you now add 95% ethanol, which acts as a decolouriser. It washes the primary stain out of some types of bacteria but not others. You then rinse the slide in water until no more colour washes off. \u2022 Finally you use a secondary or counterstain called safranin. This is a basic dye that stains the decolourised bacteria red. Leave this on for one minute and then wash off with distilled water. \u2022 Blot the slide gently dry and observe under the microscope. The bacteria that are easily decolourised and so stain red are known as Gram-negative bacteria. The bacteria that keep the primary stain and so stain purple are called Gram-positive bacteria. You will be able to tell whether the bacteria are Gram-positive or Gram-negative whatever magnification you use, but you may not be able to see the details of the bacteria unless you can use 1000x magnification. Staining bacteria is a very useful tool in helping us to identify them, and this in turn can help doctors decide how to treat an illness as Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria are affected by different types of antibiotics.",

        "chunk_text": "Drugs can be used to treat an infection once we have it. However, some diseases can cause permanent damage or even kill you, so an even better idea is to prevent you from getting ill in the first place. As you saw above, when your body has come into contact with a pathogen, some of the white blood cells develop antibodies against that micro-organism. Then if you meet that micro-organism again your body defences are ready and it is destroyed before it can cause the symptoms of disease. You are immune to the disease. You have acquired natural active immunity. However, we now have ways in which we can protect ourselves against some of the most dangerous diseases artificially. Vaccination is one of the greatest achievements of medicine and has spared millions of people from the effects of devastating diseases. Vaccines allow you to be protected from a disease without experiencing the serious effects of that illness. The immunity you need can be triggered artificially by the process known as vaccination (immunisation). When a disease is too serious to risk exposure to the real thing, vaccination gives people immunity. A weakened or dead strain of the pathogen is injected into your body. This triggers your immune response without the risk of you developing the disease. Your white blood cells develop the antibodies to the disease. Then, if in future you meet the live pathogen, your body can destroy it before you become ill. This form of artificial immunity is known as artificial active immunity. The sorts of diseases we vaccinate against are usually ones which can kill or disable. They include polio, which can leave you paralysed, tetanus, which can kill you, and tuberculosis, which can cause severe health problems and death. Measles too can cause brain damage and even death. These are all common diseases in Ethiopia. In Ethiopia, as in many African countries, we are working hard to increase the numbers of our children who are vaccinated against these deadly diseases. Parents are bringing their babies to be vaccinated even when it means that they have to travel long distances to get to the clinics. Some people find it harder than others to get the help they need. But it is important for everyone to get their children vaccinated. Vaccinations protect each individual child who is vaccinated. But once most children are vaccinated, the whole population is protected from disease and this is what we are aiming for. The more people who are immune to these diseases the sooner they will no longer threaten us here in Ethiopia. Sometimes it is too late to give a normal vaccine. If you step on a rusty nail you are at risk of developing tetanus. In some countries, if you are bitten by a dog, there is a risk of rabies. If you have not already been vaccinated, all is not lost. You can be given a vaccine which contains the antibodies you need to combat the specific pathogen. This is known as artificial passive immunity. For example, you may have a tetanus shot if you step on a rusty nail or a series of rabies vaccines if you are bitten by a dog. However, passive immunity is short-lived. You need normal vaccination once the initial danger is over. On the other hand, a mother gives a certain amount of natural passive immunity to her unborn baby via the placenta. Antibodies pass from the mother to her foetus. If the mother breastfeeds her baby once it is born, she can give it much more natural passive immunity. This is because breast milk \u2013 and in particular the colostrum that is produced in the first few days after the baby is born \u2013 is very rich in antibodies. These can protect the baby against many diseases until its own immune system gets going and starts to develop natural active immunity against pathogens. This will protect the child for as long as he/she continues to breastfeed. Much of the early work on vaccines was done by the Frenchman Louis Pasteur. He was a real family man and he was broken-hearted when three of his five children died young of infectious diseases. He was determined to do something about it. The great Frenchman convinced people by his experiments that diseases were caused by micro-organisms. He developed vaccines against some of them \u2013 most dramatically against rabies \u2013 and by the end of his life was close to a vaccine against diphtheria, the disease which had killed his little girls.",

Dead vaccines use micro-organisms which have been killed. The micro-organisms are cultured and grown for a time and then killed. More and more vaccines are being produced using just the surface antigens of the disease-causing micro-organisms. Because no disease-causing organisms go into your body, this type of vaccine gets rid of all the risks linked to using the actual micro-organisms themselves.

Tapeworms live in the intestines of their hosts. They do not feed off their host, but rather rob them of their digested food. Tapeworms do not have a digestive system so they have to absorb nutrients directly across their skin (cuticle). They also have a complex life cycle, which involves at least two different hosts. Two of the most common tapeworms that infect people are the beef tapeworm and the pork tapeworm. How do people get tapeworms? The most common way is eating undercooked or raw meat that contains a young tapeworm. Tapeworms are found in many different animals, some of which we eat and some of which we keep as pets. Fish, cows, pigs, sheep, dogs and cats are just some of the species that can be infected. Tapeworms are specially adapted to survive in the human gut. They have a head with fearsome-looking hooks and/or suckers and the worm uses these to attach firmly to the gut wall. The rest of the body is made up of about 1000 very thin segments, which contain the reproductive organs. New segments are made all the time just behind the head, so the oldest and largest segments are pushed further and further back until they break off and are passed out in the faeces, full of eggs. Problems arise when the tapeworm becomes too large and starts blocking your bowel or robbing the host of vital nutrients \u2013 very large tapeworms may cause deficiencies of vitamins such as B12 if left for too long. It can also be more serious if we play host to the intermediate stage of the parasite (see figure 4.14). In regions with poor sanitation tapeworm eggs are commonly ingested by humans instead of animals like pigs. In such cases cysticerci (see page 139) can still develop. These may form large cysts, which can be life-threatening. Tapeworm cysts may grow to a reasonable size and, because they are found deep in the tissue, they may start taking up valuable space. If the cyst settles in the brain, eye or liver, normal function of these organs may be severely restricted. In fact these cysts can cause far more problems than a live parasite in your gut.

Maintaining good sanitary conditions in and around the home will not only help prevent tapeworms but also protect against gut infections as well.

Looking at the life cycle of this animal can help us to understand just how these clever parasites get into our bodies and use our food for their own needs. Cows raised in unsanitary conditions (with access to human faeces) may contain cysticerci \u2018bladder worms\u2019 embedded in their muscles. These consist of a capsule containing a scolex. When a bladderworm is ingested (e.g. in undercooked beef), the gastric juice of your stomach dissolves the wall of the capsule. The scolex turns inside out and attaches by suckers and hooks to the wall of your intestine. It then begins to produce buds, called proglottids, which remain attached to each other for a time and, as they mature, each develops both male and female sex organs. The most mature proglottids eventually break loose and are passed out in the faeces. If conditions are such that cows get access to the human faeces, they take in the eggs and the whole cycle starts again.",

Tuberculosis can affect anyone of any age. People with weakened immune systems (such as people suffering from HIV/AIDS) are at increased risk of catching it. TB is spread by droplet infection, but you usually need prolonged exposure to someone with TB for infection to occur. Because of the way TB is transmitted, it is spread more easily when people live or work in overcrowded conditions.

The glands swell up to form \u2018buboes\u2019 filled with pus. These can also burst, releasing thick pus and forming large, painful ulcers.

If the disease has spread and the lymph glands are infected, antibiotics will still cure the disease but the glands may need to be drained of their pus to help the healing process. Preventing the spread of chancroid is very important because of the strong link between this condition and HIV/AIDS. The countries with the highest rates of HIV infection in the world are also the countries with the highest levels of chancroid. In countries with little HIV, chancroid is almost unknown. Prevention of the spread of chancroid is important both to stop the disease itself and more importantly to reduce the spread of HIV/ AIDS. We can lower the rate or even get rid of this disease by taking some simple steps. The following steps are very important: \u2022 Be faithful to your sexual partner \u2013 being celibate or having one partner is the best way to keep safe. \u2022 Use a male or female condom when you have sex. \u2022 Good genital hygiene \u2013 if you wash your genitals carefully after you have sex this greatly reduces the risk of catching chancroid. \u2022 If men are circumcised this reduces the risk of getting chancroid and it is easier to keep the penis clean. \u2022 If you think you might be infected, do not have sexual relations with anyone, visit a clinic, doctor or nurse as soon as you can to get antibiotic treatment and tell any sexual partners you may have so they can be treated too. The most serious and damaging sexually transmitted disease of all is HIV/AIDS. You will be studying this in section 4.3.",

        "chunk_text": "Used properly, medicines are a great power for good. Modern medicines such as antibiotics mean we can cure many diseases that would have caused great harm and death in the past. Vaccines mean we can protect our children from diseases such as tetanus, polio and measles so that they no longer have to suffer. Traditional medicines too have an important part to play in keeping us healthy. In Ethiopia modern medicine is becoming increasingly important, but it is not easily available to many of us. For about 80% of the population of Ethiopia, traditional medicine is used because it is there in our communities and because people have confidence in the skills of their traditional healers. Traditional medicine is often holistic, based on treating the whole patient. The medicines have been known and used for many generations and are often based on extracts of plants including herbs and spices. Medicines must be used properly if they are to cure us. Because medicines are powerful substances, if they are misused they can cause harm. So how do you use a modern medicine such as a course of antibiotics? Modern medicines are made in very carefully controlled doses so it is important to take exactly the dose given to you at regular intervals through the day. Do not take more than you are prescribed, as the drug may be harmful in large amounts. Do not take less than you are given as the drug will not work properly if the dose is too low. Make sure you finish taking all the medicine. If you do not follow the instructions when you are given antibiotics, antibiotic-resistant bacteria may evolve which can be very serious indeed. It is very important to read the instructions that come on the packet with your medicine. Medicines given to adults can be dangerous for small children, so it is important to keep all medicines well out of the way of children so they do not try them by mistake. Some modern medicines have to be kept cool. Make sure you store the medicines at the right temperature. If they get too hot the chemicals in the medicine may react or denature and then the medicine will not work as well. Many of the medicines we use in Ethiopia are traditional medicines that we get from our healers. Medicines such as dingetegna and Koso can be very powerful. However, they can also interact with other modern drugs. These interactions can cause big problems. This may mean that neither medicine works very well and they may cause extra health problems. For example, chat interferes with a commonly used antibiotic so it is not absorbed properly by your body and cannot destroy bacteria. Traditional medicines also need to be used carefully. There is a lot of work going on in Ethiopia at the moment \u2013 for example at the Ethiopian Health and Nutrition Research Institute (EHNRI) and the Biofarm Project in Addis Ababa \u2013 looking at how traditional medicines work and how effective they are. Many people will see a traditional healer or a modern health worker when they are ill. But many people try to prescribe what they or their family need for themselves. You must be very careful with self-prescribing. There are many risks associated with the practice. Of course all of us have our own remedies for a simple headache or cold, and self-prescription works well for these simple illnesses. But if there is any doubt about the cause of symptoms, we need to see a doctor. If we self-prescribe, we may not realise exactly what is wrong with us and so use the wrong medicine. We may try to remember what someone else was given for some similar symptoms, and again take the wrong thing. We might use the right medicine but take the wrong dose. And most of all, there are many conditions which need a doctor to look at and treat. If you take self-prescribed medicines, or give them to your family, you increase the risk that people will become seriously ill and even die. So only self-medicate if you are absolutely sure that you know what you are doing! Sometimes modern medicine has the best answers \u2013 vaccinations and antibiotics mean we can eliminate some very serious diseases and prevent many people from suffering and dying. But traditional medicines are also very important in helping us to recover from many common illnesses. Hopefully in the future traditional medicine and modern medicines will work together to improve the health of everyone in Ethiopia.",

It is the advanced form of an infection caused by Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV), a virus that attacks the immune system, making the sufferer susceptible to other diseases. The main way in which AIDS is spread from one person to another is by sexual intercourse. It can pass from a mother to her baby in the womb, during birth or when she breastfeeds. It can also be spread through infected blood on needles used for injecting illegal drugs, or knives used to carry out FGM or through infected blood transfusions, although in Ethiopia we screen our blood supplies so this does not happen. HIV/AIDS is a big problem in Ethiopia. Between 60 000\u201370 000 people die of AIDS every year, at the moment, and well over a million people are infected with the virus. Around 33 million people worldwide are infected with HIV. Globally, around 16 000 people are being infected every day, 6500 of them between the ages of 15 and 24 years. Eleven people are infected every minute, five of whom are young people. Around 2 million people die of AIDS every year. In Ethiopia AIDS is the leading cause of death in the 15\u201349 age group. This has enormous implications for the economy of the region, because so many of the working population are affected by the disease. Almost 72 000 people in Ethiopia died of AIDS in 2007. In the same year it was recorded that 898 350 children were orphans because their parents had died of HIV/AIDS. Around a million people in Ethiopia are living with HIV/AIDS. The social cost of HIV/ AIDS to individual people, to families and to the whole country of Ethiopia cannot be underestimated. Levels of HIV infections vary around Ethiopia. More people are infected in the cities than in rural areas, for example. In some places, particularly cities such as Addis Ababa, more women are being given the antiretroviral drugs they need to prevent the disease from spreading to their unborn children.",

        "chunk_text": "Your immune system is based in your lymph system which spreads all through your body. Your capillary walls are permeable to everything in your blood apart from the red blood cells and the large plasma proteins. As blood flows through your capillaries from the arterial system it is under pressure so fluid is squeezed out of the vessels. This fluid fills the spaces between the cells of your body and it is known as tissue fluid. It is through this fluid that all the diffusion between the blood and your cells takes place. Most of this fluid is eventually returned to your blood. Some of it moves back into the blood capillaries as they near your veins, but a lot of it drains into a series of blind-ending tubes that are part of the lymph system. Once in these tubes the fluid is known as lymph. The lymph vessels join and get larger. The lymph is moved by the squeezing effect of muscle movements and the system has a series of valves \u2013 like those found in veins \u2013 to prevent the backflow of liquid. The lymph is finally returned to your blood in the neck area, where the lymph vessels join into the large veins. Along your lymph vessels you will find your lymph glands. The white blood cells known as lymphocytes gather in these glands and produce antibodies against invading pathogens. These antibodies are carried in the lymph to the blood. The lymph glands also filter out bacteria and other microbes from the lymph to be ingested by the phagocytes. Enlarged lymph glands are a sign that the body is fighting off an invading pathogen. You can see from why doctors often examine the neck, armpits, stomach and groin of their patients. These are the main sites of the lymph glands and enlarged lymph glands suggest you have an infection. How does HIV attack the immune system? The human immune system is made up of special white blood cells which protect the body from infection. Normally when a virus enters the body, the cells which make up the immune system in the body begin to work at once. There are two main types of white blood cells in the immune system. T-cells actually bind to the antigens (see page 113/114) on the invading micro-organism and destroy it. B-cells make antibodies which bind to the antigen and destroy it. It can take some time for your body to make enough T and B lymphocytes with the right receptors to overcome a pathogen. It is while the immune system is producing our defences that we feel ill with the symptoms of the disease. HIV attacks the T-cells of your immune system. It gets inside them and so they can no longer work. You need both types of cells for your immune system to work properly, so as more and more T-cells are invaded by the virus, your immune system is less and less effective. This is why people with HIV/AIDS get so many other infections. In a healthy, well-fed person it can take many years before enough of the viruses are made to stop the immune system working completely.",

They are afraid they will not be given jobs, or will lose their job or their children will not be allowed to go to school. People might not serve them in shops. So many people will not even be tested for the disease. This means that people with undiagnosed HIV/AIDS infect others both through sexual intercourse and by mothers infecting their children through pregnancy, childbirth and breastfeeding. Now in Ethiopia people are working very hard to remove the stigma of HIV/AIDS. With help and support, people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA) can remain healthy for a long time. People need to eat as well as possible, to keep up their strength and allow their immune system to deal with the virus for as long as possible. Education means that people can learn how to avoid passing on the infection, so that the number of people living with HIV/AIDS gradually falls. In future more antiretroviral drugs will be made available so that people remain healthy for much longer.

Boys and young men must learn to respect their partners and to take responsibility for their own sexual health and that of others by using condoms. Ideally everyone would have an HIV test at the onset of establishing a new relationship. You need to develop the life skills of assertiveness and planning ahead to insist on this before you begin a new sexual relationship. Being faithful within marriage or a relationship is the safest way to avoid HIV infection. The more partners you have, and the more times you have unprotected sex, the more you put yourself at risk. If you avoid the use of substances, such as alcohol, which can affect your judgement and make you more likely to take part in risky behaviour, fewer mistakes will be made. You need to develop the skill of decision making so that you can make the safe choices which will help you avoid being infected with HIV/AIDs, and then keep to them. Problem solving is another important life skill. You need to be able to deal with the situation if your partner wants to have unprotected sex, or if you think you might have been infected with HIV.

One example is animals that are put in a group together because their limbs are built on the same basic plan. The limbs of a bat, horse, bird, human and whale all have the same basic pattern though they are used in different ways. The front limbs of a bat are adapted as wings and used for flying and climbing, whereas the limbs of a horse are used for galloping. The front limbs of a bird are also used for flying, whereas human front limbs are for using tools. In a whale, the front limbs are used for swimming. Each of these animals looks very different \u2013 yet if we look at their skeletons the bones in their front limbs are all recognisably the same. These limbs are called homologous structures. They have the pentadactyl limb pattern or five-digit plan and this has been very useful both for classifying the organisms and for tracing back their ancestors through ancient history. Many other features, from the numbers of hairs on the leg of an insect to the numbers of petals on the flower of a plant or the chemistry of the blood are also used for classification. These are known as the characteristics of the organism. Classification began centuries ago with the careful observations of scientists and anyone interested in natural history. Now, in the 21st century, we use technology to allow us to look at the genetic make-up of living organisms so that we can be sure that they are related to each other \u2013 or not! Originally scientists just looked closely at the outer (and sometimes inner) appearance or morphology of the organism. Classification was based on the degree of difference or similarity in the way they looked. Different features \u2013 for example, the number of hairs on the leg of an insect, the arrangement of fins and scales on a fish \u2013 were used to group them into species, genus and so on. In many cases you can tell just by looking at an organism what it is \u2013 you would never mistake a lion for a cheetah, for example. However, the appearance of an organism can be affected by many different things, and there can be a huge amount of variation within a group of closely related organisms. Today there are more sophisticated ways of comparing organisms. The fundamental chemicals of life \u2013 such as DNA, RNA and proteins \u2013 are found in almost all organisms. However, while these chemicals are broadly similar across all species, we can find differences when the molecules are broken down to their constituent parts.

In Ethiopia alone we have 85 living languages \u2013 and at least 11 of those have over a million native speakers! And many of us speak more than one language, often including English! All of the different languages will have different names for the same animal or plant. For example, the Ethiopian wolf is also known as the Abyssinian wolf, Simien fox, Ethiopian jackal, red jackal and Simien jackal in English, as Qey kebero in Amharic and jedala dima in Afan Oromo and Keyih Wukaria in Tigrigna. It is also named differently in different other Ethiopian languages. Around the world you also have to add languages such as English, French, Russian and Chinese into the mixture. It becomes impossible for one scientist to know what organism another scientist is talking about! The problem is solved because every organism that is classified is given a scientific name. Taxonomy began with the work of Aristotle, a philosopher who lived in Ancient Greece from 384\u2013322 BC. He tried to create a classification system for the living world, and grouped animals by similarities such as \u2018animals that live on land\u2019 and \u2018animals that live in water\u2019. He thought that some animals were higher up the order of nature than others, with human beings at the very top. He even tried to give everything a scientific name with two parts to it \u2013 he called humans \u2018rational animals\u2019. However, his system was never finished. Taxonomy became a serious science with the work of Carl Linnaeus in the 18th century. Linnaeus loved to collect plants. He qualified as a doctor, but then went back to study plants. He developed the binomial system of nomenclature for organisms, which he published in a book called The System of Nature. He suggested a way of organising living organisms from the kingdoms downwards, with a binomial system of naming them that is still used today. Binomial means two names. The two names of an organism are in Latin. Even in the time of Linnaeus, Latin was no longer spoken anywhere in the world. However, it was the language of scholars everywhere. This meant no one was offended because their language was not chosen to identify animals and plants \u2013 yet most people could understand the names. So, for example, the wolf with so many names in Ethiopia is known to all scientists as Canis simensis \u2013 so no one gets confused.",

For several centuries scientists worked with a two-kingdom classification (Animalia and Plantae) and a three-kingdom classification (animals, plants and others). There were always a lot of problems with classifying organisms such as bacteria, Euglena and fungi. As biologists have discovered more and more organisms, and understand much more about the internal structures of their cells, most of them agree that a classification system with five kingdoms makes the most sense. Viruses are not classified in any of the above kingdoms. They are grouped separately, as you will see. This is because viruses do not have all the seven characteristics of life, although most scientists now classify them as living organisms.",

Now the great differences between fungi and true plants are recognised, the fungi have a kingdom of their own. The fungi are a large and very successful group \u2013 there are around 80 000 species. They vary in size from single-celled yeasts to enormous puffballs. Fungi are eukaryotic and usually multicellular. They are heterotrophic, either absorbing nutrients directly from their food or secreting enzymes to digest their food outside the fungus and then absorbing the nutrients. Many fungi are saprotrophs, which means they feed on dead material. Saprophytic fungi usually produce huge numbers of spores, which float on the wind to other dead material. They play a vital role within ecosystems as decomposers. Examples of this type of fungus are Rhizopus (bread mould), Mucor and Penicillium (the fungus that produces the antibiotic penicillin). Fungi can be parasites, feeding on living organisms. They attack plants more than animals, although some fungi, such as Candida albicans (thrush) and Tinea pedis (athlete\u2019s foot) affect people and other animals. Fungal parasites such as the mildews cause enormous damage to plants. Some fungi are mutualists. This means they live in close association with another organism and both benefit. Examples are lichens, which are a combination of a fungus and green algae or blue-green bacteria, and mycorrhizae, an association between a fungus and the roots of a plant. Yeast, which makes injera rise and allows us to make alcohol, is one of the few single-celled fungi.",

The best examples of bryophytes are mosses like Etodon concinnus, found in the Bale Mountains, and Funaria spp. A moss plant has a simple, slender stem. They also have thin simple leaves, which are only one cell thick (and therefore useful for looking at under a microscope). Mosses also have simple root-like structures called rhizoids that have slender filaments and attach the mosses to the soil but without any strength.

The spores are dispersed by wind. However, they still rely on water for reproduction, which limits where they can live. Most ferns live in damp, shady places \u2013 they are very common in tropical rainforests where conditions are ideal for their growth. However, some ferns \u2013 such as Pteridium spp (commonly known as bracken) \u2013 are an exception because they can grow and do well in full sunlight.

The next two divisions of the plants that you are going to look at are the seed-bearing plants or spermatophytes. These are the most successful of all land plants.

A conifer tree produces two different types of cone. The male cone forms huge numbers of pollen grains that are blown by wind to a female cone. Fertilisation results in a small winged seed.

Reptiles are ectothermic \u2013 they rely on heat from their environment to regulate their body temperature. Examples include snakes, crocodiles, such as the Ethiopian crocodile, a subspecies of the Nile crocodile known as Crocodyus niloticus niloticus, and lizards, for example, the East African spiny-tailed lizard, Cordylus tropidosternum.",

The sternum or breastbone has been enlarged into a big keel shape for the attachment of the wing muscles, particularly in those birds that fly. This forms the tasty meat that is so good to eat! The jaws are toothless and are covered by a horny beak. Birds reproduce using well-developed eggs with a hard shell and in many cases the parent birds spend a lot of time and effort raising their young. Birds have light skeletons, which makes it easier for them to fly. They are also endothermic, which means they use heat produced by their own metabolism to regulate their body temperature. Of the main chordate features, only the hollow nerve cord remains in an adult bird, although the others can be seen at stages during the development of the embryo in the egg. Examples include domestic fowl, the wattled ibis (Bostrychia carunculata), white collared pigeon (Columba albitorques) and the Ethiopian eagle owl (Bubo capensis).

The number of predators in an ecosystem is one biotic component that has a big effect on the numbers of other organisms in the area. A pride of lions in an area will affect the numbers of prey animals that survive, and the number of caterpillars will make a difference to the number of plants that survive and reproduce. The amount of food available is another important biotic factor, which particularly affects animals. The food might be the number of plants growing as food for a plant-eater or the number of prey animals available for a carnivore to eat. Biotic components of an ecosystem also include the numbers of parasites and diseases. High levels of parasites or a serious disease will reduce the numbers of animals or plants in an ecosystem. Habitats may be on land \u2013 when they are known as terrestrial habitats or they may be in water, when they are called aquatic habitats. In turn there are two main types of aquatic habitat \u2013 the marine habitat, which is the salt water of the seas and oceans, and the freshwater habitat of lakes, ponds, rivers, and streams. The final biotic component which has a big effect on ecosystems is competition. There can be competition between different species all trying to get the same food, for example, and there is competition between members of the same species for the best mate, the best nest site or the most sunlight, for example. Animals compete with each other for food, water, territory and mates. Competition for food is very common. Herbivores (animals that eat plants) sometimes feed on many types of plant, and sometimes on only one or two different sorts. Many different species of herbivores will all eat the same plants \u2013 think how many types of animals eat grass! The animals which eat a wide range of plants are most likely to be successful. If you are a picky eater you risk dying out if anything happens to your only food source. An animal with wider tastes will just eat something else for a while! Competition is common among carnivores (animals that eat meat) \u2013 they compete for prey. Wildebeest are hunted by several different predators, for example. Animals often avoid direct competition with members of other species when they can. It is the competition between members of the same species which is most intense! Prey animals compete with each other too \u2013 to be the one that ISN\u2019T caught! Adaptations like camouflage colouring, so you don\u2019t get seen, and good hearing, so you pick up a predator approaching, are important for success. Competition for mates can be fierce. In many species the male animal puts a lot of effort into impressing the females, because it is often the female who chooses her mate. The males compete in different ways to win the privilege of mating with her. In some species \u2013 like deer and lions \u2013 the males fight between themselves and the winner gets the females. Sometimes the fights are mainly \u2018mock battles\u2019 but in some species the fights can be life-threatening. Many male animals display to the female to get her attention. Some birds have spectacular adaptations to help them stand out \u2013 male peacocks and birds of paradise have the most amazing feathers, which they use for displaying to other males (to warn them off) and to females (to attract them). Plants might look like peaceful organisms, but in fact the world of plants is full of fierce competition \u2013 just like animals! Plants compete with each other for light, for water and for nutrients (minerals) from the soil. They need light for photosynthesis, when they make food using energy from the sun. They need water for photosynthesis and to keep their tissues rigid and supported. And plants need minerals so they can make all the chemicals they need in their cells. When seeds from different plants land on the soil and start to grow the plants that grow fastest will win the competition against the slower growing plants. Plants are constantly competing against other plants \u2013 which are biotic components of the ecosystem. If you have ever tried to grow food in your garden or on a farm, you will know that the competition between the plants you want to grow and weeds can be fierce. We try to get rid of the weeds to remove the competition for water, light and minerals so our crops can grow as well as possible. And we plant our crop plants apart from each other so they are not competing between themselves. So the biotic components of an ecosystem have a big effect on the populations of living organisms within it.",

They make food from simple inorganic molecules \u2013 and without them little else could survive for long. Plants are phototrophs (light feeders). Because of their role in making carbohydrates, plants are known as the producers. What is more, they absorb carbon dioxide and produce oxygen in the process, maintaining the balance of gases in the atmosphere and providing us all with the oxygen which we need to live. Plants are the main source of food for many thousands of different species of animals, from the aphids which feed on houseplants to the great herds of wildebeest, zebras and elephants of Africa. Animals that eat plants are known as herbivores. Not all animals eat plants. Many of them feed on other animals and they are known as carnivores. And some types of animals, ourselves included, eat a diet that contains both plants and animals. These animals are known as omnivores. All animals and fungi are heterotrophs \u2013 they rely on eating other living organisms. There are a small number of organisms that can get energy from the breakdown of sulphur-containing chemicals. They are known as chemotrophs. Around the world much of the staple diet for human beings comes from plants. Cereal crops, pulses, nuts, fruits and berries are all the products of plant reproduction, whereas other foodstuffs come from stems, roots, leaves and storage organs. And it doesn\u2019t stop there.

Even then the animals eaten by the carnivores in their turn eat plants. It is not only human beings that are dependent on plants and the process of photosynthesis. Almost all living organisms depend on plants as the producers of food from the raw materials of carbon dioxide and water.

This is always done by plants which are known as producers. Then all of the animals that eat plants or other animals are known as consumers. Some of the energy produced by a plant is passed on to the animal which eats it. This will usually be a herbivore, although it could also be an omnivore. The herbivore (or omnivore) is known as a primary consumer, because it eats plants. Some of the energy within the herbivore is, in turn, passed on to the animal which eats it. Again, this will usually be a carnivore but could be an omnivore. The carnivore (or omnivore) is known as a secondary consumer because it eats the plant eater. This naming continues along the chain. At the end of every food chain are the decomposers \u2013 the bacteria and fungi which break down the remains of animals and plants and return the mineral nutrients to the soil. They are often not shown in food chains. Wherever you look you will find food chains which demonstrate time after time the reliance of animals on plants. Within any habitat living organisms depend on plants \u2013 the producers \u2013 to provide the food on which all of the rest of the organisms depend. The different levels within a food chain \u2013 the producers, primary consumers, secondary consumers, etc. are known as the trophic levels. Some of the simplest food chains have only two trophic levels. They come from terrestrial habitats and they describe the food we eat ourselves. For example, bananas photosynthesise and then we eat them in a wide variety of dishes. This food chain is very simple: (In food chains the arrow \u2192 means \u2018is eaten by\u2019.) banana \u2192 human On the other hand, we often eat meat, and this extends the food chain. For example, if you enjoy chicken, the food chain in which you are taking part may have three trophic levels: corn \u2192 chicken \u2192 human But if you prefer beef the chain would be: grass \u2192 cow \u2192 human Not all food chains involve people however \u2013 in fact the great majority of food chains have nothing to do with human beings at all. For example, in the seas around the Horn of Africa coral reefs are a major habitat. Tiny plant-like organisms known as algae grow on the coral, photosynthesising and making food. Parrot fish graze on these algae, before they themselves are eaten by predatory fish such as groupers. But the chain doesn\u2019t stop there as groupers in turn are eaten by larger carnivores such as the barracuda. algae \u2192 parrot fish \u2192 grouper \u2192 barracuda Many aquatic food chains start with the microscopic photosynthetic organisms known as phytoplankton (plant plankton). These tiny organisms are eaten by the equally microscopic zooplankton (animal plankton) and these two groups of organisms underpin food chains which involve almost every animal in the water, from tiny shrimps to enormous whales. In Ethiopia we have a wide variety of ecosystems and a rich variety of animals and plants. This gives us some very interesting food chains. Some are simple, some are quite long. Here are some examples: leaves and flowers \u2192 black and white colobus monkeys leaves \u2192 grasshopper \u2192 rodent \u2192 leopard grass \u2192 zebra \u2192 lion",

        "chunk_text": "As you have seen, radiation from the sun is the source of energy for all communities of living organisms. Solar energy pours out continually onto the surface of the earth and a small part of it is captured by the chlorophyll in plants. It is used in photosynthesis and the energy from the sun is stored in the substances which make up the cells of the plant. This new plant material adds to the biomass. Biomass is a term that describes all the organic material produced by living organisms. It all comes originally from plants as they photosynthesise at the beginning of all food chains. This biomass is then passed on through a food chain or web into the animals which eat the plants and then on into the animals which eat other animals. However long the food chain, the original source of all the energy and hence the biomass involved is the sun. When you look at a food chain, there are usually more producers than primary consumers, and more primary consumers than secondary consumers. This can be shown as a pyramid of numbers. However, in many cases a pyramid of numbers does not accurately reflect what is happening. For example, the breadfruit tree can grow to around 20 m tall, yet it can be attacked by mealybugs. They in turn are eaten by ladybirds. However, the pyramid of numbers for this food chain doesn\u2019t look like a pyramid at all. And cows eat grass, and people eat cows \u2013 and that doesn\u2019t make a very good pyramid of numbers either! To represent what is happening in food chains more accurately we can use biomass. Biomass is the mass of living material in an animal or plant and ultimately all biomass is built up using energy from the sun. The total amount of biomass in the living organisms at each stage of the food chain can be drawn to scale and shown as a pyramid of biomass. The biomass, and so the energy available at each trophic level of a food chain is less than it was at the previous stage. This is because: \u2022 Not the whole organism at one stage is eaten by the stage above. \u2022 When an herbivore eats a plant, it turns some of the plant material into new herbivore. But much of the biomass from the plant is used by the herbivore to release energy for living and so does not get passed on to the carnivore when the herbivore is eaten. So at each stage of a food chain the amount of biomass which is passed on is less \u2013 a large amount of plant biomass supports a smaller amount of herbivore biomass which in turn supports an even smaller amount of carnivore biomass.",

What happens to the rest? Firstly, not all of the plant material can be digested by the animal, so it is passed out of the body in the faeces. Excess protein which is eaten but not needed in the body is broken down and passed out as urea in the urine. The same is true for carnivores, they often cannot digest hooves, claws and teeth, so some of the biomass that is eaten is always lost in their waste. Part of the biomass which is eaten by an animal is used for cellular respiration. This supplies all the energy needs for the living processes taking place within the body, including movement which uses a great deal of energy. The muscles use energy to contract, and the more an animal moves about, the more energy (and biomass) it uses from its food. Much of the energy produced in cellular respiration is eventually lost as heat to the surroundings. These losses are particularly large in mammals and birds, because they are warm-blooded. This means their bodies are kept at a constant temperature regardless of the temperature of the surroundings. They use up energy all the time to keep warm when it\u2019s cold or to cool down when it\u2019s hot. Because of this warm-blooded animals need to eat far more food than cold-blooded animals like fish and reptiles to get the same increase in biomass.

        "chunk_text": "Living things are constantly removing materials from the environment. Plants take minerals from the soil and these minerals are then passed on into animals through the food chains and food webs which link all living organisms. If this was a one-way process then the resources of the Earth would have been exhausted long ago. Fortunately the materials are returned to the environment from the waste products of animals and the dead bodies of plants and animals. The nutrients held in the bodies of dead animals and plants, and in animal droppings, are released back into the soil by the action of a group of organisms known as the decomposers. These are micro-organisms such as bacteria and fungi. They feed on waste droppings and dead organisms. They digest them and use some of the nutrients. They also release waste products, and these are nutrients broken down into a form which plants can use. When we say that things decay they are actually being broken down and digested by these micro-organisms. The chemical reactions which take place in micro-organisms, like those in most other living things, work faster in warm conditions. But as in other organisms, these reactions are controlled by enzymes, and if the temperature gets too hot, the reactions stop altogether as the enzymes denature. They also stop if conditions are too cold. Most micro-organisms also grow better in moist conditions which make it easier to dissolve their food and also prevent them from drying out. So the decay of dead plants and animals \u2013 and dung \u2013 takes place far more rapidly in warm, moist conditions than it does in cold, dry ones. The majority of decomposers respire like any other organism to release energy to feed and reproduce as rapidly as possible. This means that decay takes place more rapidly when there is plenty of oxygen available. As people developed an understanding of decomposers they have also developed ways of using them in artificial situations. For example, as the human population has grown, so has the amount of human waste (sewage) produced. Not only is this material unpleasant to live with, it also carries disease. Sewage treatment plants use micro-organisms to break down the sewage and make it harmless enough to be released into rivers or the sea for the breakdown to be completed. They have been designed to provide the bacteria and other micro-organisms with the conditions they need, particularly a good supply of oxygen. At the moment we do not treat much of our human waste in Ethiopia. Another place where the decomposers are useful is in the garden. Many gardeners have a compost heap. This is where they place grass cuttings, sometimes vegetable peelings and bits they cut off plants. Then they leave it to let decomposing micro-organisms break all the plant material down to a fine, rich powdery substance known as compost. The compost produced is full of mineral nutrients released by the decomposers. This compost is then dug into the soil to act as a valuable and completely natural fertiliser. But it is in the natural world where the role of the decomposers is most important, and where the cycling of resources plays a vital role in maintaining the fertility of our soil and the health of our atmospheres. In a stable community of plants and animals living in an environment, the processes which remove materials from the soil are balanced by processes which return materials. In other words, the materials are constantly cycled through the environment. And by the time the microbes and detritus feeders have broken down the waste products and the dead bodies of organisms in ecosystems, all the energy originally captured by the green plants in photosynthesis has been transferred to other organisms or back into the environment itself as heat or mineral compounds.",

        "chunk_text": "Nitrogen is very important in a wide range of biological molecules. It is a vital part of the structure of amino acids and proteins, and it is also part of the molecules of inheritance, DNA and RNA. Plants can make carbohydrates by photosynthesis \u2013 but carbohydrates contain no nitrogen. So where does the nitrogen come from? Green plants absorb nitrogen in the form of nitrates dissolved in the soil water. They use these nitrates to make proteins, and then this protein is passed along the food chain as herbivores eat plants and are then eaten themselves by carnivores. In this way the nitrogen taken from the soil becomes incorporated into the bodies of all types of living organisms. But almost 80% of the air we breathe is made up of nitrogen \u2013 so why don\u2019t plants use that? Although it is vital to the formation of proteins and healthy growth, plants cannot use the nitrogen which is in the air around them. It is an inert gas and in that form it is so unreactive that it is no use to them at all. The nitrates taken out of the soil by plants are returned to it in a number of ways. Urine contains urea, a breakdown product of proteins, and proteins are also passed out in the faeces, so the waste passed out of animals\u2019 bodies contains many nitrogen-rich compounds. Similarly when animals and plants die their bodies contain a large proportion of protein. Some of the decomposing or putrefying bacteria and fungi which break down the waste products from animals and the bodies of animals and plants act specifically on the proteins. As they break down the protein they form ammonium compounds. These ammonium compounds are then oxidised by nitrifying bacteria which convert them to nitrates which are returned to the soil to be absorbed by plants through their roots again. Not all of the nitrates in the soil come from the process of decay. Nitrogen-fixing bacteria in the soil can actually convert nitrogen from the soil air into ammonia, which is then converted into nitrates by the nitrifying bacteria of the nitrogen cycle. There is one group of plants which plays a particularly important role in the nitrogen cycle. The legumes \u2013 that is plants such as peas, beans and clover \u2013 have nodules on their roots which are full of nitrogen-fixing bacteria. This is an example of mutualism, where two organisms live together and both benefit. The bacteria get protection and a supply of organic food from the plant, whereas the plant gets ammonia that it can use to form amino acids. The bacteria produce far more ammonia than their host plant needs \u2013 and the excess passes into the soil to be used and turned into nitrates by the nitrifying bacteria. However, not all the bacteria in the soil are helpful in the nitrogen cycle. One group, known as the denitrifying bacteria, actually uses nitrates as an energy source and breaks them down again into nitrogen gas. Denitrifying bacteria reduce the amount of nitrates in the soil!",

        "topic": "The carbon cycle",
        "chunk_text": "Another important example of the way minerals are cycled through living organisms and the environment is the carbon cycle. The element carbon is vital for living organisms because all of the main molecules of life are based on carbon atoms. There is a vast pool of carbon in the form of carbon dioxide in the air and dissolved in the water of rivers, lakes and seas. At the same time carbon is constantly recycled between living things and the environment. This is known as the carbon cycle. Carbon dioxide is removed from the air by green plants in the process of photosynthesis. It is used to make the carbohydrates, proteins and fats which make up the body of the plant. Then when the plants are eaten by animals, and those animals are eaten by predators, the carbon is passed on and becomes part of the animal bodies. This is how carbon is taken out of the environment. When green plants themselves respire, some carbon dioxide is returned to the atmosphere. Similarly when animals respire they release carbon dioxide as a waste product into the air. Finally when both plants and animals die, their bodies are broken down by the action of decomposers and when these microbes respire, they release carbon into the atmosphere as carbon dioxide, ready to be taken up again by plants in photosynthesis. In addition to all of these processes, when anything which has been living is burnt \u2013 whether wood, straw or fossil fuels made from animals and plants which lived millions of years ago \u2013 carbon dioxide is also released into the atmosphere in the process of combustion. This cycling of carbon can be summarised in a diagram (figure 6.17): For millions of years the levels of carbon dioxide released by living things into the atmosphere has been matched by the plants taking it out and the gas dissolving in the seas. As a result the level in the air stayed about the same from year to year. But now the amount of carbon dioxide produced is increasing fast as the result of human activities. We are burning huge amounts of fossil fuels in our cars, our planes and also in power stations to generate electricity. This speed means that the natural sinks cannot cope, and so the levels of carbon dioxide are building up. This build-up of carbon dioxide gas in the atmosphere is generally believed to contribute to the greenhouse effect, also referred to as global warming. Although plants take in carbon dioxide and release oxygen, the release of carbon dioxide from human activities is higher than the plants can process. The situation is made worse because all around the world large-scale deforestation is taking place. We are cutting down trees over vast areas of land for timber and to clear the land for farming. In this case, the trees are felled and burned in what is known as \u2018slash-and-burn\u2019 farming. The land produced is only fertile for a short time, after which more forest is destroyed. No trees are planted to replace those cut down. Deforestation increases the amount of carbon dioxide released into the atmosphere as burning the trees leads to an increase in carbon dioxide levels from combustion. The dead vegetation left behind decays as it is attacked by decomposing micro-organisms which releases more carbon dioxide. Normally trees and other plants use carbon dioxide in photosynthesis. They take it from the air and it gets locked up in plant material like wood for years. So when we destroy trees we lose a vital carbon dioxide \u2018sink\u2019. Dead trees don\u2019t take carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere. Methane is another greenhouse gas which causes air pollution and the levels of this gas are rising too. It has two major sources. As rice grows in swampy conditions, known as paddy fields, methane is released. Rice is the staple diet of many countries so as the population of the world has grown so has the farming of rice. The other source of methane is cattle. Cows produce methane during their digestive processes and release it at regular intervals. In recent years the number of cattle raised to produce cheap meat for fast food like burgers has grown enormously, and so the levels of methane in the atmosphere are rising. Many of these cattle are raised on farms produced by deforestation. So as a result of human activities the amount of carbon dioxide (and methane) in the air is continuing to increase. This build-up acts like a blanket and traps heat close to the surface of our earth. This causes the temperature at the surface of the earth to rise. This in turn may have many effects on our climate and health \u2013 and it is also thought to contribute to the extreme droughts, strong hurricanes and heavy rains and flooding which are affecting many different parts of the world. We have affected the atmosphere in another way too. Chemicals used as refrigerants in fridges and freezers and in aerosol cans have made the ozone layer around the earth thinner. Over the Antarctic regions there is what is known as an \u2018ozone hole\u2019 where the layer is very thin indeed. Ozone protects us from the harmful ultraviolet light in the sun\u2019s rays. As the ozone layer thins, more people are getting skin cancers and suffering eye damage from the sun. People need to be very careful with their actions \u2013 we can damage our environment without meaning to!",

Body heat is lost through your body surface (mainly your skin). The amount of heat you lose is closely linked to your surface area:volume (SA/V) ratio. This explains why so many Arctic mammals, such as seals, walruses, whales and polar bears, are relatively large. It keeps their surface area:volume ratio as small as possible and so helps them hold on to their body heat. Animals in very cold climates have other adaptations as well as a helpful surface area:volume ratio. The surface area of the thin-skinned areas of their bodies \u2013 like their ears \u2013 is usually very small. This reduces their heat loss. Look at the ears of the polar bear in figure 6.20. Many Arctic mammals also have plenty of insulation, both inside and out. Blubber \u2013 a thick layer of fat that builds up under the skin \u2013 and a thick fur coat on the outside will insulate an animal very effectively. They really reduce the amount of heat lost through the skin. The fat layer also provides a food supply. Animals often build up their blubber in the summer. Then they can live off their body fat through the winter when there is almost no food. Camouflage is important both to predators (so their prey doesn\u2019t see them coming) and to prey (so they can\u2019t be seen). Unfortunately the colours which would camouflage an Arctic animal in summer would stand out against the snow in winter. Many Arctic animals including the Arctic fox, the Arctic hare and the stoat change the greys and browns of their summer coats for pure white in the winter.",

There is scorching heat during the day followed by bitter cold at night, whilst water is constantly in short supply. The biggest challenges if you live in a desert are: \u2022 coping with the lack of water \u2022 stopping your body temperature from getting too high Many desert animals are adapted to need little or no drink \u2013 they get the water they need from the food they eat. Mammals keep their body temperature the same all the time, so as the environment gets hotter they have to find ways of keeping cool. Most mammals rely on sweating to help them cool down, but this means they lose water which is not easy to replace in the desert. Many desert animals are quite small, so their surface area is large compared to their volume. This helps them to lose heat through their skin. They often have large, thin ears as well to increase their surface area for losing heat. Another adaptation of many animals which live in hot areas is that they don\u2019t have much fur, and the fur they do have is fine and silky. They also have relatively little body fat stored under the skin. Both of these features make it easier for them to lose heat through the surface of the skin. The animals keep warm during the cold nights by retreating into their burrows. Plants grow in hot, dry areas around the world \u2013 without them there would be no food for the animals. But plants need water both for photosynthesis and to keep their tissues upright \u2013 if a plant does not get the water it needs it wilts and eventually dies. Plants take in water through their roots in the soil. It moves up through the plant and is lost through the leaves in the transpiration stream. Plants lose water all the time through their leaves. There are small openings called stomata in the leaves of a plant. These open to allow gases in and out for photosynthesis and respiration. But at the same time water is lost by evaporation. The rate at which a plant loses water is linked to the conditions it is growing in. When it is hot and dry, photosynthesis and respiration take place fast. As a result, plants also lose water very fast. So how do plants that live in dry conditions cope? Most of them either reduce their surface area so they lose less water or they store water in their tissues. Some do both!",

There are a few desert plants which have broad leaves with a large surface area. These leaves collect the dew which forms in the cold evenings. They then funnel the water towards their shallow roots. However, most plants that live in dry conditions have reduced the surface area of their leaves. This reduces the area from which water can be lost. They can reduce their surface area in a number of ways. Some desert plants have small fleshy leaves with a thick cuticle to keep water loss down. The cuticle is a waxy covering on the leaf which stops water evaporating away. Some plants in dry environments have curled leaves; this reduces the surface area of the leaf. It also traps a layer of moist air around the leaf which really cuts back the amount of water they lose by evaporation. The best-known desert plants are the cacti. Their leaves have been reduced to spines with a very small surface area indeed. This means the cactus only loses a tiny amount of water \u2013 and the spines put animals off eating the cactus as well! This adaptation has been very successful. A mature apple tree in England can lose about 100 l of water from its leaves every day. A large saguaro cactus in the desert loses less than one glass of water in the same amount of time!",

The most important adaptation for success in most plants is the way they shed their seeds. Many plants use the wind to help them. Some produce seeds which are so small that they are carried easily by air currents. Many others produce fruits with special adaptations which carry their seeds as far from home as possible. The fluffy parachutes of the dandelion \u2018clock\u2019 and the winged seeds of trees like the sycamore are common examples of flying fruits. Tumbleweeds, found on the plains and deserts of Northern America, use the whole plant to scatter their seeds! When the seeds are ripe, the plants break off at the roots and are blown away, travelling miles across the plains and scattering seeds as they go. Some plants use mini-explosions to spread their seeds \u2013 the pods dry out, twist and pop, flinging the seeds out and away. Others, like the coconut palm, rely on water to carry their seeds away. A wide variety of plants depend on animals to scatter their seeds for them. They have adaptations which encourage the animals to do this. Juicy berries, fruits and nuts are produced by plants to tempt animals into eating them. Once the fruit gets into the animal\u2019s gut, the tough seeds travel right through. They are deposited with the waste material in their own little pile of fertiliser, often miles from where they were eaten! There are even fruits which are sticky or covered in hooks which get caught up in the fur or feathers of a passing animal.

Trees produce oxygen and remove carbon dioxide from the air. They help to reduce the effects of air pollution and also reduce global warming.

Trees also help absorb water \u2013 they prevent soil erosion and help to prevent the formation of great areas of deserts.

In 2008 alone 687 million trees were planted as part of the nationwide tree-planting campaign. In fact Ethiopia tops the roll of honour for the most trees planted in a worldwide effort to rebuild some of our lost forests. So far we have planted more than 1.4 billion! This is where you can help. The idea is to plant two-year-old saplings from five of our indigenous trees, and we need young people to do this. To plant a tree successfully, the soil must be prepared, a big hole must be dug and water must be put into the hole before the tree is planted. Once the sapling is in place, the soil must be pressed very firmly around it and often a stake is used to support the young tree as it starts to grow and get established. The young trees need to be cared for once they have been planted. For at least the first year they will need extra water if the season is very dry. They may need to be protected from animals that might eat them. But if we can restore some of our lost trees, everyone will benefit, not only in Ethiopia, but across the world.",

Some types of food are needed in large amounts – these are known as the macronutrients. There are six main classes of food needed by the body. The main macronutrients are carbohydrates, proteins and fats. Other substances are equally important in your diet, but only in tiny amounts.

Any excess carbohydrate that you eat is converted to fat, which is stored all too easily in your body. The most commonly known carbohydrates are the sugars and starches. You will already be familiar with a few types of sugar: the sugar that is such an important product of many African countries, including Ethiopia, is known as sucrose; glucose is the sugar made by plants in photosynthesis and it is vital in cells for energy. It is also the energy supplier in sports and health drinks. Another more complex carbohydrate known as starch is a storage carbohydrate in plants and it is commonly found in teff and potatoes. Carbohydrate-rich foods include anything containing sugar or flour, such as injera, fatira and honey. Potatoes, rice and dabo are also carbohydrate-rich foods.

The sweet taste that is common to simple and double sugars is lost – and so is the ability to dissolve in water. But linking lots of sugar monomers (single units, in this case simple sugars) produces some complex polymers (long-chain molecules made up of lots of smaller repeating units). These polymers or complex sugars have some very important biological properties. They often form very compact molecules that are ideal for storing energy. The sugar units can then be released when they are needed to supply energy. And as complex sugars are physically and chemically very inactive, storing them does not interfere with the other functions of the cell. Starch is one of the best-known complex sugars. It is particularly important as an energy store in plants. The sugars produced by photosynthesis are rapidly converted to starch. Particularly rich sources are plant storage organs such as potatoes. Glycogen is sometimes referred to as ‘animal starch’. It is the only carbohydrate energy store found in animals. It is found mainly in muscle and liver tissue, which is very active and needs a readily available energy supply at all times. Cellulose is an important structural material in plants. It is the main constituent in plant cell walls. Just like starch and glycogen it consists of long chains of glucose – but in this case the glucose molecules are held together in a slightly different way. This is very important, because human beings, and indeed most other animals, cannot break down these linkages and so they cannot digest cellulose. So carbohydrates, from the simple sounding combination of carbon, hydrogen and oxygen, form a very varied group of molecules whose functions are vital to most living processes. There are a number of chemical tests that you can carry out to test for the presence of carbohydrates of different types. Here you are given several tests which you can try first on known samples of carbohydrates. Later you can use these same tests to discover the chemical make-up of different foods that you eat.",

        "chunk_text": "Proteins are used for body-building. They are broken down in digestion into amino acids that are then rebuilt to form the proteins you need. Protein-rich food includes all meat and fish, dairy products such as cheese and milk as well as pulses, such as white pea beans, chick peas and red kidney beans. About 17–18% of your body is made up of protein – a high percentage second only to water. Your hair, skin, nails, the enzymes that control all the reactions in your cells and digest your food, many of the hormones that control your organs and their functions, your muscles and much, much more depends on these complex molecules. By understanding the way in which protein molecules are made up and the things that affect their shape and functions, you can begin to develop an insight into the biology not only of your cells but also all living things. Just like carbohydrates and fats, proteins are made up of the elements carbon, hydrogen and oxygen, but in addition they all contain nitrogen. Some proteins also contain sulphur and various other elements. Proteins are polymers, made up of many small units joined together. These small units are called amino acids. In the same way that monosaccharide units join together to form polysaccharides, so amino acids combine in long chains to produce proteins. There are about 20 different naturally occurring amino acids and they can be joined together in any combination. Amino acids are joined together in a condensation reaction and a molecule of water is lost. The bond formed is known as a peptide link. The long chains of amino acids then coil, twist, spiral and fold in on themselves to make the complex structures we know as proteins. The structure of the proteins is held together by cross-links between the different parts of the molecule, and they can end up with very complex 3-D structures, which are often very important to the way they work in your body (see page 70 on enzymes). Amino acids dissolve in water, but the properties of the proteins that are produced vary greatly. Some proteins are insoluble in water and are very tough, which makes them ideally suited to structural functions within living things. These proteins are found in connective tissue, in tendons and the matrix of bones (collagen), in the structure of muscles, in the silk of spiders’ webs and silkworm cocoons and as the keratin that makes up hair, nails, horns and feathers. Others are soluble in water. These form antibodies, enzymes and some hormones, and are also important for maintaining the structure of the cytoplasm in your cells. The complicated way in which the structures of proteins are built up means that they can be relatively easily damaged and denatured. The relatively weak forces that hold the different parts of the amino acid chains together can be disrupted very easily. As the functions of most proteins rely very heavily on their structure, this means that the entire biochemistry of cells and whole organisms is very sensitive to changes that might disrupt their proteins. A rise in temperature of a few degrees or a change in pH is enough to destroy the 3-D structure of cellular proteins – and so destroy life itself. This is why your body has so many complex systems that keep the internal conditions as stable as possible and why very high fevers are so dangerous and can lead to death. Lack of protein in the diet may well be linked to an overall lack of energy intake, and results in a number of diseases known as protein-energy malnutrition. The best known of these are marasmus and kwashiorkor. In marasmus, both protein and overall energy intake is far below what is needed by the body. An increase of both protein and calories can save a child or adult. But if the body has not got enough protein to make the enzymes it needs it can cause death. In contrast, kwashiorkor is thought to be caused by a lack of protein in the diet even if the overall energy intake is reasonable. It is particularly common around the time a child is weaned, when a diet high in starchy foods and very low in protein is often substituted for mother’s milk. It is important to introduce protein in limited amounts as the liver is damaged and can’t deal with any excess.",

Lipids include some of the highest profile chemicals in public health issues at the moment – cholesterol and fat. Lipid-rich foods include anything containing large amounts of fats and oils. So, butter, beef fat, sesame oil, niger seed oil (nug) and olive oil are all lipids. Plant seeds like groundnuts and coconuts are also lipid-rich, providing an energy-rich store for the embryo plant. Meat, oily fish and eggs are high in lipids too. Any food that is cooked in fat or oil is also rich in lipids and the energy that they supply. Fats and oils are an extremely important group of chemicals with major roles to play in your body. They are an important source of energy in your diet and they are the most effective energy store in your body – they contain more energy per gram than carbohydrates or proteins. This is why your body converts spare food into fat for use at a later date. Combined with other molecules, lipids also play vital roles as hormones, in your cell membranes and in the nervous system. All lipids are insoluble in water, but dissolve in organic solvents. This is important because when they are present in your cells they do not interfere with the many reactions that go on in the cytoplasm, because the reacting chemicals are all dissolved in water. The best-known lipids are the fats and oils. They are chemically extremely similar, but fats, e.g. butter, are solids at room temperature and oils, e.g. niger seed oil (nug), are liquids at room temperature. The lipids found in animals are much more likely to be solid at room temperature than plant lipids. Just like the carbohydrates, the chemical elements that go into all lipids are carbon, hydrogen and oxygen. There is, however, a considerably lower proportion of oxygen in lipid molecules. Fats and oils are made up of combinations of two types of organic chemicals, fatty acids and glycerol. Glycerol is always the same, with the chemical formula C H O . On the other hand, there is a wide range of fatty acids. Over seventy different ones have been extracted from living tissues and the nature of the lipid depends a lot on which fatty acids are in it. All fatty acids have a long hydrocarbon chain – a pleated backbone of carbon atoms with hydrogen atoms attached. There are two main ways in which fatty acids vary; the length of the carbon chain can differ, and the fatty acid may be saturated or unsaturated. In a saturated fatty acid each carbon atom is joined to the one next to it by a single covalent bond. In an unsaturated fatty acid the carbon chains have one or more double bonds in them. Unsaturated fatty acids are more common in plant lipids. An example of each type of fatty acid is shown in figure 3.10. When a molecule of glycerol combines with three fatty acids, a lipid is formed. The molecules combine in a condensation reaction and a molecule of water is produced for each fatty acid that reacts with the glycerol. Recent medical research seems to indicate that high levels of fat, and particularly saturated fat, in our diet are not good for our long- term health. Fatty foods are very high in energy, and so a diet high in fats when food is in plentiful supply is likely to result in obesity. Worse than this, however, is the implication that saturated fats – found particularly in animal products such as dairy produce and meat – can cause problems in your metabolism. They seem to cause raised levels of a lipid called cholesterol in your blood. Cholesterol is a substance which you make in your liver. It gets carried around your body in your blood. You need it to make the membranes of your body cells, your sex hormones and the hormones which help your body deal with stress. Without cholesterol, you wouldn’t survive. However, high levels of cholesterol in your blood seem to increase your risk of getting heart disease or diseased blood vessels. The cholesterol builds up in your blood vessels, forming fatty deposits which can even block the vessels completely. Heart disease is one of the main causes of death in countries such as the UK and USA where people often eat far too much fatty food.",

        "chunk_text": "It isn’t just carbohydrates, proteins and fats that are important in your food. Mineral salts are needed in minute amounts, but lack of them in your diet can lead to a variety of unpleasant conditions. For example, you need calcium (Ca) in your diet to make your bones and teeth hard and strong. Without it, children develop rickets where the bones stay soft and cannot support the weight of the body so the legs become bowed. Milk and other dairy products such as ergoo and ayeeb are a very good source of this calcium. However, calcium alone is not enough to protect you from rickets. You also need vitamin D (see Vitamins). Iron (Fe) is vital to make the haemoglobin found in your red blood cells that carry oxygen around your body (see section 3.5). If your diet lacks iron you will suffer from anaemia. Iron is found in food such as red meat, liver, red teff and eggs. Without iron you don’t have enough haemoglobin in your red blood cells – in fact you can lack red blood cells – and so you don’t get enough oxygen in the tissues of your body. This makes you look pale (lack of red blood cells) and feel tired and lethargic (lack of oxygen). Your mineral needs change throughout your life – growing children need plenty of calcium for their bones to grow, whereas girls and women who have menstrual periods need more iron than others to replace the blood lost each month in their periods. The sodium ions found in your food and in the salt we often add to food are needed to survive. Without it, your nervous system would not work and the chemistry of all your cells would be in chaos. But for about a third of the population, too much salt in your diet can lead to high blood pressure. This can damage your heart and kidneys and increase your risk of a stroke. In some countries people can eat too much salt each day without knowing it. That’s because many processed, ready-made foods contain large amounts of salt. But you can control your salt intake by doing your own cooking – or by reading the labels very carefully when you buy ready-made food. In fact there is enough salt in the cells of the animals and plants we eat to supply our needs without adding any extra for flavour. Table 3.2 shows you several of the main minerals needed in the diet and the deficiency diseases associated with them.",

They are usually complex organic substances that are nevertheless capable of being absorbed directly into your bloodstream from the gut. If any particular vitamin is lacking from your diet in the long term it will result in a deficiency disease. Different foods are rich in different vitamins and it is important to take in a range of all the important vitamin-rich foods in your diet. For example, vitamin A is needed to make the light-sensitive chemicals in the retina of your eye (you will learn more about the eye in Grade 10). If your diet lacks vitamin A – found in fish liver oils, butter and carrots – your eyesight is affected and you find it almost impossible to see in low light levels. This is known as night blindness. Vitamin B , found in yeast extract and cereals, is needed for the reactions of cellular respiration to take place. If you don’t eat enough of it you get a condition called beri-beri, when your muscles waste away and you become paralysed. It can be fatal. Lack of vitamin C causes scurvy, which used to kill many thousands of sailors as they travelled the world in sailing ships. Vitamin C is needed for the formation of the connective tissue which holds your body together! You find vitamin C in fruits, particularly citrus fruits and green vegetables, and once people started to take limes and lemons on sea voyages, scurvy became a thing of the past. Vitamin D is needed for your bones to take up the calcium they need to grow strong. Vitamin D is found in fish liver oils and it is also made in your skin in the sunlight. If children don’t have enough vitamin D in their diet, or don’t get enough sunlight, they will get rickets even if they have plenty of calcium. Table 3.3 summarises four of the most common vitamins, the best food sources for them and the problems that can arise if they are deficient in your diet. These deficiency diseases can be avoided or remedied using vitamin supplements if it isn’t possible to get them all from the food you eat. The vitamins were given letters to distinguish them in the days before scientists had discovered exactly what each vitamin was. Although we now know all their chemical names, they are still usually referred to as vitamin A (retinol), vitamin D (calciferol), etc. Some vitamins are soluble in water and these include vitamin B1 (thiamine) and vitamin C. Others are fat soluble, including vitamins A and D.",

An average person can survive with little or no food for days if not weeks, but a complete lack of water will bring about death in 2–4 days, depending on other conditions such as temperature. Your body is actually between 60 and 70% water, depending on your age, how much you have drunk recently, etc. So it is not surprising that water is crucial in your body for a number of reasons, including: • All of the chemical reactions which take place in your body take place in solution in water – it is a vital solvent. • Water is involved in the transport of substances around the body – food, hormones, waste products such as urea and many other substances are all carried around your body in solution in water as part of your blood. • Water is involved in temperature regulation as you lose heat from your body through sweating (you will learn more about this in Grade 10). • Water is involved in the removal of waste materials from your body in the urine and in your sweat (see section 3.2). • Water is a reactant in many important reactions in the body – for example, as you will discover later in this section, many food molecules are broken down in hydrolysis reactions where water is added. • Water is needed for the osmotic stability of the body (see page 39, on osmosis in animals). The concentration of the chemicals in your cells and in the body fluids surrounding them must be kept constant. If there is not enough water in the blood and tissue fluid, the body cells lose water by osmosis and can no longer function, causing death.",

        "chunk_text": "Nutrition is obtaining food in order to carry out life processes. Nutrition in plants involves manufacturing their own food in the process of photosynthesis (you will learn more about this in Grade 10). In animals, including ourselves, nutrition involves taking in food based on other living organisms. Wherever you live and whatever the basis of your diet, it is not enough simply to get food. The right balance of food is of enormous importance to your overall health and well-being. A balanced diet includes enough of all the major food groups (carbohydrates, proteins, lipids, minerals, vitamins and water) to supply the energy and nutrients needed to maintain the cells, tissues and organs of your body in a healthy state. A balanced diet supports healthy growth and development of your body when it is needed. If too little food is eaten (undernutrition) or too much food is taken in (overnutrition), or any one element of the diet is lacking then you will suffer from malnutrition. Malnutrition affects the health of millions of people all over the world. One of the most important factors in a balanced diet is that enough food is eaten to supply your energy needs. But how much energy is that? The amount of energy you need to live depends on lots of different things. Some of these things you can change and some you can’t. If you are male, you will need to take in more energy than a female of the same age – unless she is pregnant. During pregnancy the energy needs of a woman increase steadily as she has to provide the raw materials for a developing baby and supply the energy it needs to live. If you are a teenager, you will need more energy than if you are in your 70s. The amount of exercise you do affects the amount of energy you use up. If you do very little exercise, then you don’t need so much food. The more you exercise the more food you need to take in to supply energy to your muscles as they work. People who exercise regularly are usually much fitter than people who take little exercise. They make bigger muscles – and muscle tissue burns up much more energy than fat. But exercise doesn’t always mean time spent training or ‘working out’ in the gym. Walking to school, running around the house and garden, looking after small children or having a physically active job all count as exercise too. Malnutrition due to too little food is a major problem in many parts of the world. Yet it is also important that too much food is not consumed. As you have seen the energy requirements of each individual vary depending on their age, sex and levels of activity. If you take in more energy than you need, the excess is stored as fat and obesity may result. In the developed world, overeating and the health issues linked to it are becoming more and more of a problem. Up to a third of the population of America is thought to be seriously overweight, mainly due to eating a diet rich in high-energy fat. You need some body fat to cushion your internal organs and to act as an energy store for when you don’t feel like eating. But when this is taken to extremes, and you consistently eat more food than you need, you may end up obese, with a BMI of over 30. Our Ethiopian diet contains a wide range of foods, and by eating a good combination we can easily achieve a balanced diet. For example, a daily menu such as: Breakfast: bread and groundnuts or chick peas with tea or milk Lunch: kei wot with injera and orange or banana Dinner: shiro wot with injera and fresh green pepper These meals would give you a good balanced diet. If food is short in times of drought or other difficulty, then the diet becomes unbalanced and lacking in calories and various nutrients. On the other hand, if we are tempted by too much processed or fried food then we can become obese and put ourselves at risk.

        "chunk_text": "Carbohydrates provide the body with an energy source for respiration. Proteins are needed for building new cells and repairing old ones. Lipids are also an energy source and they provide a way of storing spare energy. However, in the form that they are usually eaten neither carbohydrates, proteins nor fats are useful to the body. The link between what comes in and what the body needs is the digestive system. The human body needs small, soluble molecules to use in all the reactions of metabolism such as releasing energy and making new larger molecules. The food we eat usually arrives in the system as large chunks bitten off by the teeth, chunks that contain large insoluble molecules such as starch, proteins and fats. These large molecules cannot be absorbed into the bloodstream and used by your body so they need to be broken down into smaller, simpler, soluble molecules. This is the main job of the digestive system – food substances are broken down into small soluble molecules as they pass through the gut. As you have seen earlier in this chapter, the large molecules that make up the carbohydrates, proteins and fats are built up from small molecules that are joined together by condensation reactions, with a molecule of water being lost each time. When these large molecules are broken down during digestion it involves the opposite process – hydrolysis (splitting with water) reactions. As water molecules are added to the large food molecules, the monomer units, whether they are simple sugars, amino acids or fatty acids, are released. The working of your digestive system is based on two things: • The physical (or mechanical) breakdown of the food: The food you eat is physically broken down into smaller pieces in two main ways. Your teeth bite and chew the food up in your mouth. Then your gut, which is a muscular tube, squeezes the food and physically breaks it up, while mixing it with various digestive juices to make it easier to move. By breaking the food up in this way, there is a much larger surface area for the digestive enzymes to work on. • The chemical breakdown of the food: The large insoluble food molecules must be broken down by hydrolysis reactions into small, soluble molecules so they can be absorbed into your body. This chemical breakdown is controlled by enzymes. Enzymes are proteins that speed up (catalyse) other reactions. They do not actually take part in the reaction or change it in any way except to make it happen faster. Enzymes are biological catalysts that usually work best under very specific conditions of temperature and pH.",

Enzymes are made of protein, and like any catalyst are not affected by the reaction they speed up, so they can be used many times. Enzymes are very specific – each type of reaction that takes place in your body is controlled by a specific enzyme that does not catalyse any other type of reaction. Some enzymes work inside your cells (intracellular enzymes) and some of them are secreted into organs of your body such as the gut where they catalyse specific reactions (extracellular enzymes). The digestive enzymes are extracellular – they work outside your cells in the lumen of your gut.

        "chunk_text": "The process by which the food you eat is taken into your body, broken down and used by your cells, with the indigestible material removed, is very complex and it involves the various areas of your digestive system or gut. As we eat our food, it sets off on a journey of digestion. The first stage is ingestion, or taking foodstuff into your body through the mouth. We bite off a chunk of food using our teeth, and then physically chop the food up into smaller pieces by chewing it. Your teeth play a very important role at the beginning of the process of digestion, physically breaking down your food and providing a greater surface area for your digestive enzymes to work on. This process is known as mastication. Teeth have evolved to be very strong – in fact the enamel that covers them is the strongest substance made by the human body. Teeth are needed for a variety of different jobs – gripping food, tearing food and chewing food, for example. The shape of different teeth means they are ideally suited to their different functions. Because humans have a very varied diet (we are omnivores so we eat animals and plants) we also have a variety of different types of teeth. The incisors and canines are used for biting while the premolars and molars are used for chewing and crushing food. All of your teeth have a similar make-up. The top surface is covered by a layer of non-living enamel, and under this is the living dentine. This is not as hard as enamel, but it is still very hard, being similar to bone. In the centre of the tooth is the pulp cavity, which contains nerves and blood vessels. The dentine contains many fine channels filled with cytoplasm. These are supplied with oxygen and nutrients by the blood vessels in the pulp cavity. Your teeth are set into your jaw bone, and they are held in place by a layer of fibrous cement. This cement keeps your teeth firmly in place but at the same time allows a certain amount of flexibility as you are chewing. Your adult teeth should last you all through your life. This doesn’t always happen, because your teeth can be affected by the bacteria that cause dental caries. There are many different bacteria that are found naturally in your mouth. These bacteria, combined with food and saliva, form a thin film known as plaque on your teeth. If these bacteria are given a sugar-rich diet (in other words, if you eat a lot of sweet, sugary food) they produce a lot of acid waste. This acid attacks and dissolves the tough enamel coating of your teeth. Once through the enamel, the acid also dissolves away some of the dentine and then the bacteria can get into the inside of your tooth. The bacteria will then reproduce and feed, eating away at your tooth until they reach the nerves of the pulp cavity causing toothache. The bacteria and the acid they produce can eat away at your teeth to the extent that they break up completely if you don’t get effective dental treatment. What’s more, the bacteria don’t only attack your teeth. The same bacteria can affect your gums, causing periodontal disease. The symptoms include tender gums, bleeding when you clean your teeth and eventually the possible loss of all your teeth, not from tooth decay but from gum disease. Taking in lots of acidic food and drink, such as fruits and cola, can also weaken the enamel on your teeth. This is particularly the case if you clean your teeth straight after an acidic drink such as fruit juice or cola, when the softening effect on the enamel is strongest and brushing your teeth can actually wear the enamel away. Tooth and gum disease are extremely common all over the world. They cause pain, bad breath, loss of teeth and difficulty eating. The good news is that they can both be avoided, especially if you have good dental care available. Ways to avoid tooth decay include: • Regular brushing of your teeth and gums twice a day. This removes the plaque from the teeth, preventing the build-up of a sticky, acidic film over the enamel. • Avoiding sweet, sugary foods – if the bacteria in your teeth are deprived of sugar, they cannot make acidic waste and your teeth are safe. If they are available: • Have regular dental check-ups. A dentist can clean your teeth more thoroughly than you can, and any early signs of decay can be treated. Your teeth won’t heal themselves, but any tooth decay can be removed and replaced by a filling. The breaking down of your food into smaller pieces by the chewing of your teeth isn’t the only part of digestion that takes place in your mouth. Your food is also coated in saliva from the salivary glands. Saliva contains a carbohydrase enzyme called amylase. Carbohydrases break down carbohydrates. The amylase in your saliva begins the digestion of the starch in complex carbohydrates such as bread or potatoes, turning it into simpler sugars. The saliva- coated chunk of food (known as a bolus) moves to the back of your throat to be swallowed. Swallowing is a reflex action that takes place when food reaches the back of your throat. As you swallow, your epiglottis closes over the trachea, preventing food going down into your lungs; you can’t swallow and breathe in at the same time. If you try to, you will choke and your body will produce violent coughing and heaving movements to make sure the food doesn’t get down into your lungs, where it can cause serious problems. When your food is swallowed it travels down the oesophagus or gullet, squeezed along by muscular contractions known as peristalsis. As a result you can eat at any angle you like – even standing on your head – because food does not rely on gravity to arrive in your stomach. Peristalsis is not confined to your oesophagus – it is important all the way through your gut to move the food through as it is digested, to mix the food with the digestive enzymes produced in the various parts of the gut and to continue the physical break-up of the food. The walls of your gut have a layer of circular muscles forming rings around it and a layer of longitudinal muscles that run the length of the gut. Waves of alternate contraction and relaxation of the different muscles (see figure 3.23) move food through from one end of the gut to the other. At the lower end of the oesophagus your food passes through a ring of muscle called a sphincter into your stomach. This sphincter is usually closed except when you are swallowing food, or being sick. The stomach is a muscular bag that produces protease enzymes to digest protein. The main protease made in the stomach is pepsin. The stomach also produces a relatively concentrated solution of hydrochloric acid. This acid kills most of the bacteria that are taken in with our food. The acid also helps indirectly in the breakdown of the protein in your food, because pepsin works best in acid conditions. Your stomach also makes a thick layer of mucus, which protects the muscle walls from being digested by the protease enzymes and attacked by the acid. The muscles of your stomach squeeze the contents into a thick creamy paste containing partly digested protein along with all the rest of your food. After a time – usually between one and four hours – a paste of partly digested food is squeezed out of the stomach through another sphincter into the first part of the small intestine known as the duodenum. As soon as it arrives the food is mixed with two more liquids: bile and enzymes.",

It is made by the liver cells and then stored in the gall bladder until it is needed. As food comes into the duodenum from the stomach, bile is squirted onto the stomach contents. The bile does two important jobs: • It neutralises the acid from the stomach and makes the semi- digested food alkaline. This is ideal for the enzymes in the small intestine, which work most effectively in an alkaline environment. • Bile also emulsifies the fats in your food – it breaks down large drops of fat into smaller droplets. This provides a much bigger surface area of fats for the lipase enzymes to work on to break down the fats completely into fatty acids and glycerol.",

Part of the pancreas makes the hormone insulin, which helps to control your blood sugar levels (you will learn more about this in Grade 10). The rest of the pancreas makes and stores enzymes that digest carbohydrates, proteins and fats. As food enters the small intestine from the stomach these enzymes are released to be mixed with the food paste by muscle action. The rest of the small intestine is a long (6–8 m) coiled tube that produces carbohydrase, protease and lipase enzymes of its own. The tube is coiled up to fit inside the body cavity. Your food, which is rapidly becoming completely digested in the alkaline environment, is moved along by peristalsis. Throughout the small intestine enzymes speed up the breakdown of large molecules into smaller molecules. The main types of enzymes found in the human digestive system are summarised in the table below: Once the food molecules have been digested, giving glucose, amino acids, fatty acids and glycerol, they are absorbed by your body (absorption). They leave the small intestine by diffusion and go into the blood supply to be carried around the body to the cells that need them. The lining of the small intestine is specially adapted to allow as much diffusion as possible and as rapidly as possible. It has many finger-like projections of the lining (called villi) to increase the surface area for diffusion, and each individual villus in turn is covered in even smaller projections called microvilli. The villi also have a rich blood supply that carries away the digested food molecules and maintains a steep diffusion gradient. The diffusion distances are very small, and the whole process takes place in a water-based solution. All of these factors make the absorption of the digested food molecules from the small intestine into the blood supply very efficient. The glucose molecules and amino acids go directly into the blood. The fatty acids and glycerol move initially into the lacteals, which are part of the lymph system. The lymphatic fluid with its load of fatty acids and glycerol then eventually drains into the blood as well. Once the digested food molecules have all been taken into the blood they are taken in the hepatic portal vein to the liver, which processes some of the food (see section 3.5). The remaining products of digestion are carried around the body to the cells where they are needed. They are built up into the molecules required by the cells. This is known as assimilation.",

In this wide, thin-walled tube water is absorbed back into bloodstream by diffusion. By the end of the large intestine the thick paste that remains is known as the faeces. The journey ends as the faeces leave the body through the rectum and the anus as a result of a final set of muscle contractions. This removal of the faeces from your body is called egestion. It is not excretion because excretion involves the removal of the waste products from the cells, and the final contents of your gut have never been inside your cells. The number of times people pass faeces varies from person to person and with the diet that is eaten. Once a day is probably average, but some people go several times a day, while others may go only once or twice a week. The colour of your faeces comes from the breakdown products of your bile. If you have problems with your gall bladder or bile duct, your faeces may turn silvery-white as they are missing the pigments from your bile. So at the beginning of the process of digestion you eat a meal, taking food into your body. After several hours the digestive process, including ingestion, physical and chemical digestion, absorption, assimilation and egestion, will be complete. The time it takes to digest a meal completely will depend on a variety of things – in particular, the size of meal you eat and the type of food it contains. If the nutritional balance of the food you eat is right, the chances of your body remaining fit and healthy throughout your life are greatly increased.",

This is constipation and the most common causes are a lack of fibre in the diet and not drinking enough water. Straining to pass faeces can cause haemorrhoids (piles) or a tear in the anus. Constipation can usually be treated relatively easily. This may involve eating more fibre (which gives the muscles of the gut more material to work on), drinking plenty (so the faeces remain soft) and sometimes taking laxatives (chemicals which stimulate the gut to contract and force out the faecal material). If the faeces become completely compacted (which happens very rarely) they can block the gut. This is a very serious situation which may have to be relieved by surgery. On the other hand, if an infection causes the gut to contract more strongly or more rapidly than usual, the faeces that are produced may be very loose and watery. This is known as diarrhoea. Often this condition clears up within 24 hours, but in the very young and the very old – and anyone if it persists – diarrhoea can be fatal as it causes dehydration of the tissues. It can be treated very simply by giving the sufferer frequent drinks of water with rehydration salts (mainly salt and sugar). These replace the fluids that are being lost and keep the body tissues hydrated until the immune system overcomes the infection. Millions of people around the world, particularly children and old people, die from untreated diarrhoea every year. It is not only the balance of food in your diet that can affect your health. There are a number of food-borne diseases. Bacteria growing on food that you eat can make you very ill and even kill you. For example, raw meat and raw eggs can contain bacteria such as salmonella that cause diarrhoea and sickness (vomiting). In most people food-borne diseases are not too serious, but young children, the elderly and anyone who has other health problems can be very seriously affected. You need to maintain very strict food hygiene when you are preparing food to avoid these diseases. Store raw meat and eggs separately from salad vegetables and fruit. Wash the knives used to cut meat and the work surfaces on which it is prepared before preparing salads or cutting cheese. Disinfect work surfaces regularly. And most important of all, anyone preparing food must wash their hands between handling different types of food and when they have been to the toilet. Gut bacteria from the faeces can be transferred from the hands to the food very easily and cause stomach upsets to spread around a family or a community. Some of the food we eat is preserved so that it will last longer. There are a number of ways of preserving food and they all work by preventing bacteria from growing on the food. When food is canned it is heated to high temperatures and sealed so that the air cannot get in – this kills the bacteria which might cause food poisoning and deprives them of the oxygen they need to grow. Bottling is a similar process which uses glass bottles – people can bottle their own excess crops as well as buying commercially produced bottled food. Often a sugar syrup or brine is used. Again this method kills the bacteria with heat, deprives them of oxygen and also causes osmotic damage using the sugar or salt solution. When food is packed in a vacuum pack the air is sucked out of the packaging which is then sealed. This means there is no oxygen available so bacteria cannot grow in the food. Finally food can be dried – there is no water so bacteria cannot grow and the food stays good. All of these methods of preserving food should mean that the food lasts a very long time and remains safe and good to eat. However, you need to be careful and employ good food hygiene even when using canned or packaged foods. Here are some of the precautions you should use: • Check that the ‘best before’ date stamped on the can or package is OK. In many cases, particularly with tinned food, the ‘best before’ date means that the food will not taste at its best rather than that it will be going bad and a health risk. However, it is always best to avoid eating food that is past its ‘best before’ date to avoid the risk of infections. • Make sure that the can, bottle or packet has not been damaged in any way which would allow air into the container. If air gets into a food container it carries microbes with it which can grow on the food using oxygen from the air to respire. Some of these micro-organisms can cause disease if you then eat the food. Others produce toxins (poisons) as they grow which can cause severe illness and death if they are eaten. • Once a food container has been opened, eat the contents quickly. If anything is left over, store it in a refrigerator to keep the temperature low if possible to stop bacteria growing. If not, keep the food as cool as possible and cover it to prevent flies from landing on it and transferring microbes from their feet and mouthparts to the food. • Check for any bulging in the shape of a can which might show you that bacteria have got into the tin and grown, producing gases which build up and make the tin bulge.",

Up to their optimum temperature, raising the temperature increases the rate of reaction. Once the temperature goes above the optimum, the protein structure of the enzyme is denatured, the shape of the active site is destroyed and the rate of the reaction decreases rapidly. • Enzymes work best at specific pH levels – pH affects the structure of the active site. • Different areas of the gut have different pHs to suit the enzymes involved. • The process of eating your food involves ingestion, digestion, absorption, assimilation and egestion. • The human digestive system is a muscular tube running through the body with specialised areas adapted to carry out different parts of the digestive process. • Peristalsis is a wave of muscular contraction pushing food along the gut. • The liver makes bile, which emulsifies fats, increasing the surface area for enzyme action. • The ileum has a very large surface area due to the presence of villi and microvilli. This enables the digested food products to be absorbed into the blood and lymph systems. Water is removed from the remaining undigested food in the large intestine and the remaining material is egested from the body as the faeces. • Food must be handled and stored carefully to avoid the transmission of diseases.",

        "chunk_text": "Your respiratory system is beautifully adapted for the job it has to do. Your nose contains the nasal passages, which have a large surface area, a good blood supply, lots of hairs and a lining that secretes mucus. The hairs and mucus filter out much of the dust and small particles such as bacteria and pollen that we breathe in, whilst moist surfaces increase the humidity of the air we breathe into our bodies and the rich blood supply warms it. All this means that the air we take in is already warm, clean and moist before it gets into the delicate tissue of our lungs. As air moves down into the trachea it passes the oesophagus – the entrance to your gut. Whereas air can – and does – make its way down into your gut, this doesn’t matter as you can simply bring it back up in the form of a burp. However, it is very important that food does not get into your lungs. It can block the airways or cause a fatal infection and so the epiglottis closes off your trachea every time you swallow in a reflex action (you will learn more about this in Grade 10). You cannot swallow and breathe at the same time. At the top of your trachea sits your larynx or voice box. By directing air leaving the lungs over the vocal cords (flaps of muscle) in the larynx, you produce the sounds that you use in speech. The trachea itself has a series of incomplete rings of cartilage (shaped like the letter C) that support it and hold it open. They are incomplete so that you can swallow your food. Your oesophagus and trachea run next to each other so as a lump (bolus) of food moves down your oesophagus it presses against your trachea. If the trachea had solid cartilage rings this would be very uncomfortable. But the open part of the ring faces the oesophagus so the food passes by with no problems (see figure 3.30). The lining of your trachea secretes mucus, which like the surface of the nose collects bacteria and dust particles. The cells that line the trachea are also covered in hair-like cilia that beat to move the mucus with any trapped micro-organisms and dirt away from your lungs and towards your mouth. This mucus is then either swallowed and digested or coughed up. The trachea splits into two tubes; the left and right bronchi (singular bronchus), one leading to each lung. The bronchi are also supported by rings of cartilage. Inside your lungs, the bronchi divide into smaller tubes known as the bronchioles. The bronchioles are much smaller than the bronchi, dividing into ever smaller tubes until they reach the main structures of the lung",

        "chunk_text": "For your respiratory system to work you need to move air into your lungs and then move it out again. This is brought about by movements of the ribcage, which you can see and feel, and by movements of the diaphragm, which you can’t. The breathing movements are brought about by two different sets of muscles that change the pressure in the chest cavity. When we breathe in, our ribs move up and out, and the muscles of the diaphragm contract so that it flattens from its normal domed shape. The intercostal muscles between the ribs contract, pulling them upwards and outwards at the same time as the diaphragm muscles contract to flatten the diaphragm. These two movements increase the volume of your chest (thorax). Because the same amount of gas is now inside a much bigger space, the pressure inside the chest drops. This in turn means the pressure inside the chest is lower than the pressure of the air outside. As a result air moves into the lungs. Then, when the intercostal and diaphragm muscles relax, the ribs drop and the diaphragm domes up. The volume of the thorax is decreased, so the pressure inside your chest increases as the air is squeezed and forced out of your lungs. You breathe out. This movement of air in and out of the body is known as ventilation of the lungs. We have two sets of intercostal muscles. In normal, quiet breathing we use only our external intercostal muscles, which lift our ribs. When these muscles relax, our ribs fall back to their original position due to gravity. However, if we need to breathe out deliberately, forcing the air out of our lungs, or when we are exercising really hard, we also use our internal intercostal muscles, which pull the ribs down hard and squeeze more air out of your lungs. You can also use the muscles of your abdomen deliberately to increase the amount of air you move in or out of your lungs. Professional singers often make use of this when they perform.",

        "topic": "The process of gaseous exchange",
        "chunk_text": "Breathing in supplies us with the oxygen we need for cellular respiration, while when we breathe out waste carbon dioxide is removed from the body. But how is this exchange brought about? When the air is breathed into the lungs, oxygen passes into the blood by diffusion along a concentration gradient. At the same time carbon dioxide passes out of the blood into the air of the lungs, also by diffusion along a concentration gradient. This exchange of gases takes place in the alveoli, the tiny air sacs with a large surface area that make up much of the structure of the lungs. The movement of oxygen into the blood and carbon dioxide out of the blood takes place at exactly the same time – there is a swap or exchange between the two and so this process is known as gaseous exchange. The tiny air sacs of the alveoli provide an ideal site for the most effective possible diffusion of gases into and out of the blood. They have a very large surface area that is kept moist. This is important for the most effective diffusion of the gases, as they need to be in solution to diffuse into the blood. The alveoli also have a rich blood supply, which is vital if substances are going to move into and out of the blood. The blood that the heart pumps to the lungs has come from the active body tissues and is low in oxygen and relatively high in carbon dioxide. Oxygen is constantly moved into the blood, but more deoxygenated blood immediately replaces it. Similarly, carbon dioxide is constantly delivered to the lungs, where it is diluted in the volume of air maintaining a concentration gradient between the blood and the air in the lungs. This is made even steeper each time new air moves into the lungs. As a result gas exchange in both directions can take place along the steepest concentration gradients possible, so that it occurs rapidly and effectively. Within the alveoli, the gases in the air and the gases dissolved in the blood are only separated by two cell layers, a distance of only about a thousandth of a millimetre, so the diffusion distances are as short as possible. This means that diffusion takes place as quickly as possible. The mechanism of gas exchange in the alveoli depends on a large surface area, moist surfaces, short diffusion distances, and a rich blood supply maintaining steep concentration gradients. The breathing movements tell us that air is moved into and out of the lungs. If we analyse the gases in inhaled and exhaled air we can compare their composition and show the levels of oxygen and carbon dioxide change.",

This supplies the oxygen needed for all of the normal activities of your cells, but it does not use up all of the capacity of your lungs. When you are breathing normally at rest, you take about 500 cm3 of air in and out each time you breathe – this is only about 15% of your possible maximum. This is known as your tidal volume of air. The vital capacity of your lungs is the absolute maximum amount of air you can take into or breathe out of your lungs. If you need more oxygen for any reason, you have two ways of getting more air into your body. You may breathe faster and you may breathe more deeply, taking more air into your body with each breath. Usually you do a combination of the two. So what factors affect your breathing rate? Anything that increases the oxygen requirements of your body will tend to increase your breathing rate. The main factors known to have an effect are: • Exercise • Anxiety • Drugs • Environmental factors • Altitude • Weight • Smoking",

        "chunk_text": "Even when you are resting, your muscles use up a certain amount of oxygen and glucose. This is because some of your muscle fibres are constantly contracting to keep you in position against the pull of gravity. Muscles are also involved in your life processes such as breathing and circulation of the blood. But when you begin to exercise, your muscles start contracting harder and faster. As a result they need more glucose and oxygen to supply their energy needs. During exercise the muscles also produce increased amounts of carbon dioxide, which needs to be removed for them to keep working effectively. So during exercise, when muscular activity increases, your breathing rate increases and you breathe more deeply. These changes mean that not only do you breathe more often, but you also bring more air into your lungs each time you breathe. This increases the amount of oxygen brought into your body and carried to the exercising muscles. It also means more carbon dioxide can be removed from the blood in the lungs and breathed out. Exercising and getting fitter means your lungs get bigger. They can supply more oxygen to your muscles so you build up much less oxygen debt. As a result fit people often have a slower breathing rate than unfit people, because they take more air in and out with each resting breath. Regular exercise has been shown to have a number of benefits for health and fitness. It keeps your muscles toned, so that the fibres are constantly slightly tensed and ready to contract. This speeds up your reaction time and uses up energy, helping you to maintain a healthy body weight. When you use your muscles regularly they get stronger as more muscle fibres develop. Another benefit is that your muscles are much less likely to feel stiff and sore after exercise when you use them regularly. The blood supply to your muscles increases, bringing glucose and oxygen to the tissues more efficiently, removing carbon dioxide and avoiding oxygen debt. Your joints also tend to work more smoothly if you take regular exercise. This is because the blood flow to your joints is increased so your body maintains and repairs them more effectively. The benefits of regular exercise are not confined to your muscles and skeleton. Your heart and lungs benefit too. Both the heart and the lungs become larger, and they both develop a bigger and very efficient blood supply. This means they function as effectively as possible at all times, whether you are exercising or not.",

However, we do also smoke shisha, and also people use native tobaccos such as gaya, which may be smoked in a pipe, inhaled like snuff or chewed. In spite of this, scientific evidence suggests that many deaths in Ethiopia are smoking-related. In the year 2000, statistics showed that nine people in every 100 000 of the population died of smoking-related cancers such as lung cancer, and 18.9 in every 100 000 died of cancers linked not just to smoking and inhaling cigarettes but also to pipe smoking and chewing tobacco, such as cancers of the mouth and throat. Every cigarette smoked produces around 4000 chemicals that are inhaled into the lungs. Every time you inhale shisha, pipe smoke or cigarette smoke these chemicals are taken into your mouth, throat and lungs and some go into your blood. Nicotine is the addictive drug found in tobacco smoke. Carbon monoxide is a very poisonous gas found in cigarette smoke. It takes up some of the oxygen carrying capacity of the blood – after smoking a cigarette up to 10% of a smoker’s blood will be carrying carbon monoxide rather than oxygen. This can lead to a shortage of oxygen for the smoker, and the effect is most marked in pregnant women. If the mother’s blood does not contain enough oxygen as a result of smoking, the foetus is deprived of oxygen and does not grow as well as it should.

In a smoker, the cilia which move things away from the lungs are anaesthetised by each cigarette and stop working for a time, allowing dirt and bacteria down into the lungs. Tar makes smokers more likely to develop bronchitis – inflammation and infection of the bronchi. The build-up of tar in the delicate lung tissue can also lead to a breakdown in the alveolar structure. In these chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases (COPD) the structure of the alveoli break down and much larger air spaces develop. This means the surface area of the lungs is reduced. As a result the person affected is always short of oxygen and feels breathless. COPD kills and disables millions of people around the world. Tar is also a major carcinogen (a cancer causing substance). Lung cancer – the most well-known disease linked to smoking – is the result of this accumulation of tar. Up to 90% of lung cancers are directly the result of smoking. Tobacco smoking is also linked to cancers of the throat, mouth and larynx – the whole respiratory tract is affected. The chemicals in tobacco smoke also affect the heart and blood vessels, making it more likely that blood vessels will become blocked, causing heart attacks, strokes and thrombosis.

This is usually due to poor oral hygiene – often food trapped on the teeth or the tongue causes bad breath. You must clean your teeth and tongue – particularly the back of the tongue – regularly to avoid bad breath. However, sometimes bad breath is due to problems with the gut or the kidneys. So if bad breath does not clear up, visit the doctor. If you have an infection such as a cold or tuberculosis, you will spray out the microbes that cause disease every time you speak or laugh, but most of all when you cough or sneeze. It is very important to cough or sneeze into your hand or the crook of your elbow and then wash it immediately. This avoids passing germs into the air for other people to breathe in. If a dentist or doctor is going to examine a patient, they may wear a mask over their mouth and nose.

Once breathing stops, death will result in a matter of minutes as the brain in particular is starved of oxygen. However, it is possible to take over breathing for a casualty in this situation, and this may be enough to keep them alive until medical support arrives. The way this is done is by expired air resuscitation, which is also more commonly known as mouth-to-mouth resuscitation. The idea of this technique is that you keep forcing air into the lungs of the person who has stopped breathing, so that gaseous exchange can continue and their tissues continue to receive oxygen. It is very important that mouth-to-mouth resuscitation should ONLY be given when the casualty has stopped breathing, not just when they are unconscious. The procedure for this is as follows: 1. Call for help loudly. Use a phone to get help if you can. 2. Check to see if the casualty is conscious – use their name if you know it, ask their name and ask if they can hear you. NEVER use artificial respiration on a conscious patient. Call for help. If you are sure the patient is unconscious… 3. Open the airway. Remove any obstacles from the mouth which might block the airway, e.g. water weed, vomit. Tilt the head back and lift the chin. This opens the airways and may be enough to start breathing again. Call for help again. 4. Check for breathing. Put your head near the casualty’s nose and mouth. Look along the chest to check for breathing movement. Listen for the sounds of breathing. Feel for breath on your cheek. Observe for at least 5 seconds before you decide the person is not breathing. Call for help. NEVER use artificial respiration on a casualty who is breathing. 5. Make sure the airway is open and the head is tilted back. Pinch the casualty’s nostrils closed with one hand. Keep the chin lifted with the other hand. 6. Use a clean piece of cloth over the mouth to avoid the transfer of HIV through contact and other infections. Take a deep breath and then seal your mouth around the person’s mouth. Breathe out firmly into the person’s mouth until you see the chest rise. This will show you that you are getting air into their lungs. 7. Remove your lips and let the chest fall naturally. 8.

        "chunk_text": "Respiration releases energy from the food we eat so that the cells of the body can use it. The energy that is used by the cells is stored in the form of a molecule known as ATP, which stands for adenosine triphosphate. This is an adenosine molecule with three phosphate groups attached to it. When energy is needed for any chemical reaction in the cell, the third phosphate bond is broken in a hydrolysis reaction. This results in a new compound, ADP or adenosine diphosphate, a free inorganic phosphate group – and the all-important energy needed in the cell. This is a reversible reaction, and so during cellular respiration the energy from the reactions of glucose with oxygen is used to produce large quantities of ATP ready for use in the cells. This is why cellular respiration is so very important – ATP is the single energy providing and energy storing molecule for all the processes in living cells. • Your cells need energy from ATP to carry out the basic functions of life, known as metabolism. One of their main functions is to build up large molecules from smaller ones to make new cell material (anabolism). Much of the energy released in respiration is used for these ‘building’ activities. Cells also break large molecules down into smaller molecules. This is known as catabolism and it also requires energy. anabolism + catabolism = metabolism • Another important use of the ATP energy from respiration is in making muscles contract. Muscles are working all the time in our body, even when we are not aware of using them. Even when we are asleep our heart is beating, our rib muscles and diaphragm contract as we breathe, our gut is churning – and all of these muscular activities use energy. • We are ‘warm-blooded’. This means that our bodies are the same temperature inside almost regardless of the temperature around us. On cold days we use energy to keep our body warm, whilst on hot days we use energy to sweat and keep our body cool. • The ATP produced by aerobic respiration in cells also provides energy for the active transport of some materials across cell boundaries.",

        "topic": "Anaerobic respiration",
        "chunk_text": "The energy released by aerobic respiration in muscle cells allows them to move. However, during vigorous exercise the muscle cells may become short of oxygen – the blood simply cannot supply it fast enough. When this happens the muscle cells can still obtain energy from the glucose but they have to do it by a type of respiration that does not use oxygen (anaerobic respiration). Anaerobic respiration produces far less ATP than aerobic respiration. It also produces a different waste product called lactic acid. The body cannot get rid of lactic acid by breathing it out as it does carbon dioxide, so when the exercise is over, lactic acid has to be broken down. This needs oxygen, and the amount of oxygen needed to break down the lactic acid is known as the oxygen debt. Even though our leg muscles have stopped, our heart rate and breathing rate stay high to supply extra oxygen until we have paid off the oxygen debt. After exercise, the lactic acid is oxidised by oxygen to produce carbon dioxide and water. Anaerobic respiration: glucose → lactic acid + energy (ATP) Oxygen debt repayment: lactic acid + oxygen → carbon dioxide and water When muscle cells have been used for vigorous exercise for a very long time they become fatigued, which means they stop contracting efficiently. They switch to anaerobic respiration, and as the levels of lactic acid build up, your muscles really start to ache. This is known as muscle cramp. Also, anaerobic respiration is not as efficient as aerobic respiration. It does not break down the glucose molecules completely so far less ATP energy is released than during aerobic respiration. So your muscles tire more rapidly and cannot work as well when they are respiring anaerobically, as there is not enough energy for them. Anaerobic respiration isn’t simply something that affects people. It takes place in all living organisms, and in a number of cases we have put anaerobic respiration to very good use, both in our industries and in our homes. For example, one of the micro-organisms that is most useful to people is yeast, a single-celled fungus. When yeasts have plenty of oxygen they respire aerobically, breaking down sugar to provide energy for the cells and producing water and carbon dioxide as waste products. However, yeast can also respire anaerobically. When yeast cells break down sugar in the absence of oxygen they produce ethanol (commonly referred to as alcohol) and carbon dioxide. The anaerobic respiration of yeast is sometimes referred to as fermentation. The yeast cells need aerobic respiration because it provides more energy than anaerobic, so it allows them to grow and reproduce. However, once there are large numbers of yeast cells, they can survive for a long time in low oxygen conditions and will break down all the available sugar to produce ethanol. glucose → ethanol + CO2 + energy (ATP) We have used yeast for making bread and alcoholic drinks almost as far back as human records go. We know yeast was used to make bread in Egypt in 4000 BC, and some ancient wine found in Iran dates back to 5400–5000 BC. You will be learning more about using yeast in your studies in Grade 10.",

Small, single-celled organisms rely on simple diffusion to exchange materials between the outside world and the inside of their cells. The diffusion distances are short, so diffusion works really well. However, as animals get larger and are made up of more and more cells, simple diffusion alone is not enough to supply the body needs; there is simply not enough surface area available for the exchanges to take place. This is partly because as animals get bigger, the ratio between the surface area and the volume gets smaller. As diffusion takes place through the surface area but has to reach the innermost volume, the bigger the organism, the less effective simple diffusion becomes as a means of transport. Human beings are made up of billions of cells, most of them a very long way from a direct source of food or oxygen, so a more complex transport system is required to supply the needs of the body cells and remove the waste material they produce.",

In the systemic circulation blood is pumped from the heart all around the body and back again. A double circulation like this is very important in warm-blooded, active animals like ourselves because it is very efficient. It lets our blood get fully oxygenated in the lungs before it is sent off to the different parts of the body.

        "chunk_text": "A very important element of any transport system is the pathways along which the transport takes place. In the human body we have three main types of blood vessels, arteries, veins and capillaries, which are adapted to carry out particular functions within the body, although they are all carrying the same blood. The arteries carry blood away from the heart so they have to be able to withstand the pumping of the heart forcing the blood out into the circulation. This is usually oxygenated blood so it is bright red. Arteries have thick walls that contain muscle and elastic fibres, so that they can stretch as the blood is forced through them and go back into shape afterwards. Arteries have a pulse in them that you can feel at certain places in the body (like the wrist) where they run close to the surface – the pulse is the surge of blood from the heart when it beats. Because the blood in the arteries is under pressure, it is very dangerous if an artery is cut because the blood spurts out rapidly every time the heart beats. This means blood is lost very rapidly and the bleeding is difficult to stop. The only arteries that carry deoxygenated blood are the pulmonary arteries, which carry the blood away from your heart to your lungs, and the umbilical artery, which carries blood away from a foetus into the placenta (you will learn more about this in Grade 10). The veins carry blood towards your heart – it is usually low in oxygen and so is a deep purple-red colour. They have much thinner walls than arteries and the blood in them is under much lower pressure because it is a long way away from the thrust of the heart. They do not have a pulse, but they often have valves to prevent the back-flow of blood as it moves from the various parts of the body back to the heart. The only veins that carry bright red blood are the pulmonary veins, which carry oxygenated blood back from your lungs to the left-hand side of your heart, and the umbilical vein, which carries oxygenated blood from the placenta back to the developing foetus to supply it with the food and oxygen it needs to grow. Between the arteries, that bring blood from the heart, and the veins, that take it back to the heart, are very narrow, thin-walled blood vessels called capillaries. The capillaries link the other two types of blood vessels. These take the blood into all the organs and tissues of the body. The capillaries are the site of the exchange of substances within the body. Blood from the arteries passes into the capillaries, which have very thin walls and a massive surface area. Substances such as oxygen and glucose that are needed by the cells of your body can easily pass out of the blood by diffusion along a concentration gradient. In the same way substances produced by the cells such as carbon dioxide pass into the blood through the walls of the capillaries. The blood leaves the capillary network flowing back into veins to be returned to the heart and recirculated around the body.",

The heart is made up of two pumps that beat at the same time so that blood can be delivered to the body about 70 times each minute. The heart is made up of a unique type of muscle known as cardiac muscle, which can contract and relax more or less continuously without fatiguing. The walls of the heart are almost entirely muscle. These muscular walls are supplied with blood by the coronary arteries, so that they have a constant supply of glucose and oxygen and the carbon dioxide produced is not allowed to build up in the tissue. The deoxygenated blood is carried away in the coronary veins, which feed back into the right atrium. The walls of the atria are relatively thin, so they can stretch to contain a lot of blood. The walls of the ventricles are much thicker, as they have to pump the blood out through the major blood vessels. The muscle walls of the left-hand side of the heart are thicker than on the right (see figure 3.51). This is because the left-hand side of the heart has to pump blood around the whole body whilst the right-hand side pumps only to the lungs.",

Inside the heart there are many different valves. Their names describe their appearance – bicuspid (two parts) tricuspid (three parts) and semilunar (half-moon). Each time the muscular walls of the heart contract and force blood out, some of these valves open to allow the blood to flow in the right direction, and other valves close to make sure that the blood does not flow backwards. The noise of the heartbeat we can hear through a stethoscope is actually the sound of these valves transporting the surging blood. First the atria fill with blood and then the ventricles fill, followed by the contraction of both ventricles, emptying the heart. Diastole is when the heart muscles relax and it fills with blood. Systole is when the heart muscles contract and force the blood out of the heart. The pressure at which the blood travels around your arteries varies as the heart beats. So when doctors measure your blood pressure they usually do it in a way that covers the two extremes of the cardiac cycle. At systole, when the heart is contracting and forcing blood out into your arteries, the blood pressure is at its highest – this is the systolic blood pressure and it is the higher of the two readings taken. At diastole, when the heart is relaxed and filling, the pressure is lower – this is the diastolic blood pressure and it is the lower reading. A normal blood pressure is 120 mmHg/80 mmHg – usually quoted as 120 over 80 or 120/80. Your blood pressure will vary through the day and depending on what you are doing. Blood pressure is used as a measure of the health of both the heart and the blood vessels.",

However, physical exercise means that muscles need more food and oxygen to work, and so the heart needs to supply more blood. It does this in two ways. The heart beats faster – the pulse rate can easily go up from rest to 120 or even 140 beats a minute, increasing the amount of blood flowing around the body. The heart can also increase the amount of blood pumped out at each heartbeat. If people do lots of physical exercise and are fit, their heart responds by becoming bigger and stronger. Because their heart pumps more blood with each beat, fit people tend to have relatively slow resting heartbeats – some are as low as 50 beats a minute. Your heart doesn’t beat with a steady rhythm all the time – it responds to all the needs of your body.

        "topic": "The blood",
        "chunk_text": "The heart and the blood vessels are there to carry the transport medium around your body – and the transport medium is your blood. Your blood is a complex mixture of cells and liquid that carries a huge range of substances around the body. It consists of a liquid called the plasma, which carries red blood cells, white blood cells and platelets. The plasma is a pale yellow liquid that transports all the blood cells but also a number of other things. Carbon dioxide produced in the organs of the body is carried in the plasma back to the lungs. Similarly urea, a waste product from the breakdown of excess proteins formed in the liver, is carried in the plasma to the kidneys where it is removed from the blood to form urine. All the small, soluble products of digestion pass into the blood from the gut. They are carried in the plasma around the body to the organs and individual cells that need them. One of the main components of your blood is the red blood cells. There are more red blood cells than any other type of blood cell. They are superbly adapted to their role in carrying oxygen around your body and supplying it to the cells where it is needed. The red blood cells can do this because they are packed with a special red substance called haemoglobin, which picks up oxygen. Haemoglobin is a very special red pigment, a large protein molecule folded around four iron atoms. In a high concentration of oxygen, such as in the lungs, the haemoglobin reacts with oxygen to form oxyhaemoglobin. This is bright scarlet, which is why most arterial blood is bright red. In areas where the concentration of oxygen is lower, such as the cells and organs of the body, the reaction reverses. The oxyhaemoglobin splits to give purple-red haemoglobin (the colour of venous blood) and oxygen. The oxygen then passes into the cells where it is needed by diffusion. This reversible reaction makes active life as we know it possible by carrying oxygen to all the places where it is really needed. The red blood cells are made in your bone marrow and once they are mature they lose their nucleus. This means that there is more room to carry extra haemoglobin – another adaptation to their all-important function. Because they have no nucleus, the red cells only live 100–120 days in your body, so they are constantly being replaced. Because the haemoglobin in your red blood cells is based on iron, it is important to eat enough iron in your diet. Without it, the body cannot make enough red blood cells and you suffer from anaemia. People who are anaemic are pale and lack energy, because they cannot carry enough oxygen around the body for their needs. The red blood cells have a unique shape – they form biconcave discs. This is another adaptation to their function. The shape gives them a large surface area to volume ratio for the diffusion of oxygen into and out of the cell. It also means they are relatively thin, giving short diffusion distances, which again makes the exchange of gases more efficient. Red blood cells also have a thin surface membrane for ease of diffusion. This allows them to squeeze easily through the very narrow capillaries. Another important component of your blood is the white blood cells. They are much bigger than the red cells and there are fewer of them. They have a nucleus and form part of the body’s defence system against microbes. Some white blood cells – the lymphocytes – form antibodies against microbes whilst others – the phagocytes – engulf invading bacteria. You will find out more about the role of the white blood cells in your body when you study the immune system later in this book. Platelets are another component of your blood. They are small fragments of cells and they are very important in helping your blood to clot at the site of a wound. When platelets arrive at a wound site they are involved in the formation of a network of protein threads. Then as more platelets and red blood cells pour out of the wound they become entangled in the mesh of threads forming a jelly-like clot. This soon dries and hardens to form a scab. The clotting of the blood is a very important process. It prevents you from bleeding to death from a simple cut. It also protects your body from the entry of bacteria and other pathogens (disease-causing micro-organisms) through an open wound, and protects the new skin from damage as it grows.",

        "chunk_text": "A number of special proteins called antigens are found on the surface of all cells. They allow cells to recognise each other and also to recognise cells from different organisms. If the cells of your immune system recognise a foreign antigen on a cell in your body, they will produce antibodies. These antibodies will join on to the antigen and destroy the foreign cells. This is how your immune system recognises and fights the organisms which cause disease. A number of different antigens are found specifically on the surface of the red blood cells. This gives us the different human blood groups. There are several different blood grouping systems, but the best known is the ABO system. In this system there are two possible antigens on the red blood cells – antigen A and antigen B. There are also two possible antibodies in the plasma, known as antibody a and antibody b. Unlike most other antibodies, these antibodies are present in your body all the time. They are not made in response to a particular antigen. If the blood from different blood groups is mixed together, there may be a reaction between the antigen and the complementary antibody which makes the red blood cells stick together (agglutinate). This means they cannot work properly. They block the capillaries and even larger blood vessels. Most of the time this is not important since everyone keeps their own blood in their own circulatory system. But if someone loses a lot of blood in an accident, an injury, when giving birth or during an operation then they may need a blood transfusion. This is when blood taken from one person is given to another to save their life. Before a transfusion it is vital to know the blood groups of both the person giving the blood (the donor) and the person receiving the blood (the recipient). This means the right type of blood can be given to prevent agglutination. The blood groups must be compatible. It is not usually the case that only one type of blood can be given, simply that blood containing a particular antigen must not be mixed with blood containing the matching antibody. For example, blood group O has no antigens so it can be given to anyone, but someone who has blood group O has both antibodies so they can only receive group O blood! On the other hand someone with blood group AB which has no antibodies can receive any type of blood! There is another important factor which affects the safety of blood donations. HIV/AIDS is a very serious disease which affects the blood and the immune system. If someone receives a blood donation from a person infected with HIV/AIDS they too will become infected. For this reason all blood which is used for blood donations needs to be screened carefully. Only people who are free from HIV infection should donate blood, and blood should be treated to remove any risk of cross-infection. You will be learning a lot more about HIV/AIDS in section 4.3 of this book.",

If you are anaemic you have too few red blood cells in the body, or the levels of the oxygen-carrying red pigment haemoglobin in your blood are too low. There are a number of causes of anaemia. The most common is a lack of iron in the diet. As you saw in section 3.1, iron-rich food includes meat and liver as well as apricots, eggs and some green leafy vegetables. If your diet is lacking in these foodstuffs, you may suffer anaemia. The main symptoms are tiredness and lack of energy, because your body cells are constantly deprived of oxygen. This means you cannot study or work as effectively. Girls are more likely to be anaemic than boys because they lose iron each month in their menstrual bleeding. Women are more likely to be anaemic than men because of the demands of pregnancy when they need to take in enough iron for both themselves and their developing baby, and because of the blood loss during and after childbirth. However, both men and women who are malnourished can be affected by anaemia. Anyone who suffers an injury and bleeds a lot, or who has internal bleeding for any cause, is also likely to become anaemic if they do not have a blood transfusion and a diet rich in iron. Hypertension is another common complaint of the circulatory system. Hypertension is the medical name for high blood pressure. Blood pressure is considered high if the systolic pressure is greater than 140 mmHg or the diastolic pressure is greater than 90 mmHg. For 90% of the cases of hypertension, the cause is unknown. For the other 10%, hypertension is a symptom of another disease, such as chronic kidney diseases or diseases in the arteries supplying the kidneys, chronic alcohol abuse, hormonal disturbances or tumours. There are a number of factors that can increase the risk of you developing hypertension. Many of these factors mean that your blood vessels are likely to be getting narrower, or becoming more rigid, both of which increase your blood pressure. These factors include: increasing age, being overweight, excessive salt intake, excessive consumption of alcohol, sedentary (inactive) lifestyle, smoking, kidney diseases, diabetes and certain medicines, such as steroids. There is also evidence to suggest that hypertension may be genetic (i.e. run in the family).",
