This cell then engulfed other smaller cells that were better at respiring organic molecules to release energy. The endosymbiont theory is also a theory of the origin of eukaryotic cells. A eukaryotic cell is a type of cell that has a nucleus.\n\nSource: \nID: rec_86, SCORE: 0.5, HEADER: How did eukaryotic cells originate?, PAGE_NUMBER: 122.0\nSource: \nID: rec111, SCORE: 0.45, HEADER: How did eukaryotic cells originate?, PAGE_NUMBER: 123.0\nSource: \nID: rec_9, SCORE: 0.45, HEADER: What are bacterial cells like?, PAGE_NUMBER: 5.0\nSource: \nID: rec105, SCORE: 0.44, HEADER: what are prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells?, PAGE_NUMBER: 122.0\n"}
