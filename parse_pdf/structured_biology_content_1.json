        "chunk_text": "Biology is the science of life and living organisms. You know from earlier studies that an organism is a living being made from one cell (for example bacteria, unicellular algae) or many cells (for example, animals, plants and most fungi). When we think of biologists, we often have quite a narrow view of what they do. But, just as all chemists don\u2019t wear white coats, all biologists don\u2019t look down microscopes in laboratories. Here are just a few of the areas of biological study. Some biologists become astrobiologists. These biologists engage in all kinds of research to try to find evidence of life on other planets in our Solar System and in galaxies elsewhere in the Universe. Other biologists take part in biomedical research. These biologists help in many areas, including the development of new drugs and vaccines. They also study the ways in which diseases develop to gain a better understanding of them so that cures can be found. Others still become microbiologists. These biologists study how micro-organisms of all kinds function. Some micro-organisms cause disease, and understanding how they work makes a treatment more likely. Many microbiologists are studying the human immuno-deficiency virus (HIV) to get a better understanding of how AIDS develops and how it can be treated. Paleobiology is a fascinating area of study to many people. Paleobiologists try to find out more about the way in which life began on Earth and how it has evolved from simple life forms into more complex ones. They use evidence from fossils and from studies of the chemistry of ancient rocks to make estimates of when and how new life forms appeared on the planet. Many different biologists are involved in the Human Genome Project. This enormous project has produced the first ever map of the 46 chromosomes found in human cells. It has located the tens of thousands of genes and has determined the exact structure of each chromosome. Although the \u2018map\u2019 is finished, there is still much to be found out. Analysis will continue for many years to come. Besides these biologists, there are others who are, perhaps, more recognisable. These include: doctors, dentists, veterinary surgeons, nurses, physiotherapists, botanists, zoologists, physiologists, biochemists, agricultural biologists, ecologists, ethologists, entomologists, geneticists, oncologists, neurobiologists, parasitologists . . . . . . and many, many others besides.",

But science isn\u2019t just about having knowledge: science is a unique system of acquiring knowledge based on the scientific method. This science is sometimes called experimental science, because it depends very heavily on experimentation to obtain the information. This is different from applied science, in which scientific research is used to meet certain human needs. However, it is often difficult to separate the two. Science is an ongoing effort to find new information and principles which can increase human knowledge and understanding. In their research, scientists collect evidence that supports or disproves a particular suggested explanation of a natural phenomenon. One important idea in science is that any suggested explanation of a phenomenon should be capable of being proved wrong. If there is no way of proving it wrong, how can other people accept that it is correct? This is what distinguishes science from religious beliefs.",

For centuries, people based their explanations of what they saw going on in the world around them on observations, without testing their ideas to see if they were true. One ancient belief was that simple living organisms could come into being by spontaneous generation. This idea suggests that non-living objects can give rise to living organisms. As an example: \u2022 Observation: Every year in the spring, the river Nile flooded areas of Egypt leaving behind mud containing many nutrients that enabled the people to grow that year\u2019s crop. However, along with the muddy soil, large numbers of frogs appeared that weren\u2019t around in drier times. \u2022 Conclusion: Muddy soil gives rise to frogs! Also, before the invention of the refrigerator, animal carcasses were hung by the heels in butcher\u2019s shops and people would ask the butcher to cut off the part they wanted. The shop was always full of flies. So people believed that the meat had turned into flies! Because of these and other observations, many people, including quite eminent \u2018scientists\u2019 of the day, produced recipes for \u2018creating\u2019 life from non-living objects.

        "topic": "How did the scientific method disprove the idea of spontaneous generation?",
        "chunk_text": "What about the belief that rotting meat produces flies? How could you disprove that by using the scientific method? Well, in 1668 an Italian biologist, Francesco Redi, did just that. Many scientists consider this to be the first true \u2018experiment\u2019. He used wide-mouth jars containing meat. Some jars were left open to the air. Others were covered with a piece of gauze. After several days, maggots and then flies could be seen in the open jars, but none appeared in the closed jars. Redi hypothesised that only flies could produce more flies and predicted that, in his experiment, flies would be found in the open jars, but not in the covered jars. He maintained all the jars under the same conditions and so he controlled many variables. By choosing to cover some jars with gauze rather than an impermeable seal, he allowed air to enter all the jars \u2013 again he controlled a variable that could have affected the outcome of the experiment. His results matched his prediction and when other people tried the experiment, they too got the same results. Redi was able to conclude that flies cannot be produced from rotting meat. He also went on to say that it was unlikely that any form of spontaneous generation was possible. Most people accepted this for larger organisms, but, at round about this time, the microscope had been invented and the whole world of microbiology was opened up. Many people still believed that micro-organisms could arise by spontaneous generation. It took the work of Louis Pasteur to disprove this. In 1859, Pasteur carried out experiments to show that the micro-organisms that caused wine and broth to go cloudy came from the air and were not made from the broth itself. He used special \u2018swan-necked flasks\u2019 like that shown in Figure 1.4. Pasteur boiled broths in swan-necked flasks to kill any micro-organisms that might be in them. The boiling forced steam and air out of the flasks. When the boiling stopped and the broth cooled, air was sucked back into the flasks. Some contained a filter to prevent all solid particles from getting into the growth medium from the air. Others had no filter but, in these, the dust (and the micro-organisms) in the air settled in the lowest part of the neck of the flask. All the flasks were kept under the same conditions in Pasteur\u2019s laboratory. Pasteur found that the broths stayed clear for months. At the end of this time, he treated the flasks in one of three ways: \u2022 He left some of them as they were. \u2022 He broke the necks on some. \u2022 He tilted others to allow the dust in the low part of the neck to mix with the broths. The broths in the second two groups of flasks turned cloudy (due to the presence of micro-organisms) within days. The broths in the first group remained clear. After this, people were forced to admit that spontaneous generation, even of micro-organisms, could not happen. One stage in the scientific method is to \u2018do background research\u2019. Pasteur certainly did that. He knew that other scientists had tried to disprove spontaneous generation before him and he was able to draw on the results of their experiments and improve their technique.",

        "chunk_text": "Scientific experiments try to establish cause and effect. This means that they try to prove that a change in one factor brings about a change in another factor. The factor that the scientist changes, or manipulates, is called the independent variable (or IV for short). The factor that the scientist measures to see if it changes when the IV is changed is called the dependent variable (or DV for short). The scientist will want to find out if changes in the independent variable produce changes in the dependent variable. In the example on pages 5 and 6, the independent variable was the presence or absence of tomato juice. The dependent variable was the number of tomato seeds germinating. To prove cause and effect \u2013 to prove that it is changes in the IV (and nothing else) that are causing changes in the DV \u2013 we must take all the steps we can to ensure that the experiment is a fair test. We must make sure that any other factors which could affect the results are the same for the different conditions we set up. In the tomato seed example, if one group of seeds had been at a higher temperature than the other group, this could have made them germinate faster. We wouldn\u2019t have known whether it was the tomato juice affecting the results or the temperature. Our experiment would not be valid. So we must keep constant anything other than the IV that might influence the results. These are controlled variables. In the tomato seed experiment, the controlled variables were: \u2022 temperature \u2022 lighting conditions \u2022 number of seeds per dish, and \u2022 volume of liquid added (water or tomato juice). Occasionally, there is a variable that might influence the results that you can\u2019t control. Such a variable is a confounding variable. This is because it \u2018confounds\u2019 the interpretation of the results. You couldn\u2019t be certain that it was the IV producing the changes in the DV because of the presence of the confounding variable. For example, if you measure the carbon dioxide uptake by wheat plants as the light intensity changes over the day, you cannot control the effect of change in temperature.

For example, if you were timing a reaction that was likely to last a few minutes at most, the stop-clock would be the best choice. But if you were timing something that lasts several hours, you just don\u2019t need that level of precision and it might even be a hindrance \u2013 by measuring the seconds accurately, you might lose track of the hours! To measure volume, you could use: \u2022 a syringe \u2022 a measuring cylinder \u2022 a pipette \u2022 a burette All of these come in various sizes. Look at the ones shown in the diagrams.

It is important, then, that the layout of the report is recognisable to everyone and understandable by everyone. So, there is a set way to lay out such a report. It is not always identical in every case, but there are certain \u2018rules\u2019 to follow. Experiments can be reliable without being necessarily valid. If you consistently omit the same important step (for example, consistently forget to control the same variable), you may well keep getting the same results. But they will be the wrong results and your experiment will not be valid. You can measure the rate of fermentation of yeast using simple equipment as shown in the diagram below. You can count the number of bubbles of carbon dioxide produced in five minutes and work out a rate per minute. There must be: \u2022 a title, which states clearly what is being investigated \u2022 a hypothesis, stated clearly in terms of how the independent variable is expected to influence the dependent variable, often extended to a prediction for the particular experiment \u2022 a clear description of the experimental procedure; this must be in such detail that anyone of the same level of understanding could easily replicate the procedure and it must include: \u2013 the apparatus used (a diagram of the assembled apparatus is useful) \u2013 details of any chemicals used; what volumes or concentrations or masses were used \u2013 details of any organisms used (for example, yeast, mice) \u2013 what strain and how many \u2013 details of any control experiments \u2022 a full account of the results obtained; it is often helpful to summarise these (where appropriate) in graphs, charts and tables \u2022 the conclusions that have been drawn from the results \u2022 an evaluation of the procedure; this is an honest assessment of the limitations of the procedure that has been used, pointing out any unavoidable limitations and inaccuracies that arose \u2022 an acknowledgement of the use of any other person\u2019s work; this is usually done by identifying by a number the place in the report where other work has been used, and then listing the sources at the end of the work So, for the tomato seed experiment, the report could look something like this: Section How it would be written Title An investigation into the effect of tomato juice on the germination of tomato seeds. Hypothesis A chemical in tomato juice inhibits the germination of seeds. Prediction Seeds covered in tomato juice will germinate less well than seeds covered in distilled water. Procedure 30 tomatoes were blended for five minutes. The blended material was then filtered through some muslin and the liquid (juice) was collected. The seeds were extracted from the cellular material, which was then discarded. The juice was diluted with distilled water to give a total volume of 550 cm3. The tomato seeds were washed in distilled water for 30 seconds, to remove any chemicals from their surface. They were dried briefly on filter paper. 100 Petri dishes were prepared by placing a piece of filter paper in each. Each piece of filter paper had a 0.5 cm grid drawn on it. 20 seeds were placed in each Petri dish on the intersections of the lines of the grid (to ensure even spacing in all dishes). 10 cm3 tomato juice was added to half of the Petri dishes and 10 cm3 distilled water was added to the other half. All the dishes were placed in an incubator at a temperature of 20 \u00b0C for four days. At the end of this time the number of successful germinations in each dish was recorded and means for each condition were calculated. If a radicle (root) of 0.5 cm or more was present, the seed was said to have germinated. Results Out of 1000 seeds sown in each condition, 668 germinated in the distilled water (13.36 per dish) and 265 germinated in the tomato juice (5.3 per dish). Conclusion The hypothesis is accepted. The germination of the seeds in the tomato juice is much less successful than in distilled water. Some chemical in the tomato juice must therefore be inhibiting the germination. In tomato fruits, no seeds germinate, but it must be remembered that in our investigation, the juice had been diluted to give sufficient volume for 50 replicates of the investigation. Evaluation There were no anomalous results. The germination of seeds in all of the dishes in the experimental condition (the tomato juice) was less successful than in the dishes in the control condition (distilled water). The experiment was not without limitations. \u2022 It was only carried out for four days (to limit the development of fungal growth that might have interfered with germination). Had it been carried out for longer, the pattern may have been different. \u2022 It was only carried out at one temperature; this may have influenced the experimental and control conditions differently. Repeating the investigation at a range of temperatures would help to clarify this. \u2022 The judgement of germination (a radicle of 0.5 cm length) was somewhat arbitrary, but it did overcome the problem of including in the count seeds that had merely swollen with water but not produced any growth. We are of the opinion that these limitations had only a minor effect on the validity and reliability of this experiment.

These include: \u2022 microscopes \u2022 dissecting equipment \u2022 Petri dishes \u2022 pipettes and syringes \u2022 centrifuges \u2022 measuring cylinders \u2022 balances We have already considered measuring cylinders, pipettes and syringes when looking at the idea of \u2018accuracy\u2019 in scientific experiments. All these are used for measuring volumes, usually of liquids, but in some investigations they can be used to measure the volume of a gas. In this example, an upturned measuring cylinder is being used to collect oxygen gas produced when yeast converts hydrogen peroxide into water and oxygen. Some syringes are designed specifically as \u2018gas syringes\u2019 and could be used as an alternative way of collecting the oxygen in the above experiment. Balances are used for measuring mass. They come in a range of sizes and properties. Some can measure the mass of very heavy objects, but not with any great degree of precision. Others measure smaller masses to the nearest 0.0001 g (one ten-thousandth of a gram). Sometimes biologists need to dissect specimens to find out what they are like inside. This need not always mean dissecting a whole organism. Quite often, students dissect organs, such as the heart or the kidney, to find out about their structure. Biologists may dissect owl pellets \u2013 these are pellets containing the parts of food that the owl has eaten and that cannot be digested and have been regurgitated. Dissecting these can give information about what the bird has been eating. Figure 1.11 shows a standard dissecting kit containing a magnifying glass, scalpels, scissors, forceps (tweezers) and mounted needles. Figure 1.12 shows a student dissecting a frog. The student is using a scalpel to cut away the skin and reveal the abdominal organs. These can then be removed and studied individually. Petri dishes are round dishes made from glass or from plastic. They are used in many different ways, but usually to culture some organisms. They are often filled with a \u2018jelly\u2019 called agar and used to culture bacteria. There are many different agars containing different balances of nutrients. Each type of agar can encourage the growth of different bacteria. By marking a grid on the surface of the Petri dish, biologists can estimate how much of the dish is covered by bacteria and then use this to estimate how fast the bacteria are growing. Petri dishes are also used to propagate or culture plants. Petri dishes can also be used to: \u2022 show how effective different antibiotics are against certain types of bacteria \u2022 show how well different concentrations of enzymes digest a substance This Petri dish has one type of bacterium growing all over it \u2013 except in some of the areas near the white discs. These discs contain different antibiotics. The clear zones around the discs are areas where no bacteria are growing. Clearly some antibiotics are more effective against this bacterium than others. This Petri dish contains agar mixed with starch. There are several \u2018wells\u2019 in the agar which contain a starch-digesting enzyme. The whole area has been stained with iodine, which turns blue-black when it reacts with starch. The clear areas around the wells show that the enzyme has diffused out of the wells and digested the starch. As you know already from your study in grade 9, microscopes are one of the most vital tools in a biology laboratory. There are two main types: \u2022 optical microscopes that use beams of light to produce magnified images \u2022 electron microscopes that use beams of electrons to produce magnified images You are unlikely ever to use an electron microscope, simply because of cost. Light microscopes vary from basic microscopes that can be used in the laboratory and even taken out and used in the field to very sophisticated microscopes that are linked to image-enhancing computer programs to produce all kinds of images that help to make the image clearer. Of course, biologists also use electron microscopes that give much higher magnifications and, importantly, much higher resolution, so that more detail can be seen. Transmission electron microscopes allow researchers to view the structure of cells in great detail. The transmission electron micrograph (TEM) of the cell from the leaf of a tobacco plant in figure 1.18B shows six large chloroplasts, the vacuole of the cell and the nucleus and cytoplasm. Scanning electron microscopes do not see \u2018into\u2019 cells in the same way, but create images of the surface of a specimen by scanning it with a high-energy beam of electrons. Computer programming allows the different parts to be \u2018false coloured\u2019 for clearer interpretation. This is shown in the scanning electron micrograph (SEM) of the head of a monarch butterfly, figure 1.18A. Centrifuges are used to separate solids from liquids where simple filtration is not adequate for the task. Some solid particles are very tiny and float around in a liquid, although they are not properly dissolved in the liquid. Centrifugation can separate these solid particles from the liquid without the need to filter. The mixture is placed in a \u2018centrifuge tube\u2019 and placed in the centrifuge. The centrifuge then spins the tubes at high speed. As the tubes spin, the gravitational forces on the solid particles force them to the bottom of the tube. Some centrifuges, called \u2018ultracentrifuges\u2019, can spin really fast and cause extremely light particles to fall to the bottom of the tube. These ultracentrifuges are used to separate the various components of animal and plant cells. Centrifugation is commonly used in hospitals for stool tests where the ability to separate particles quickly and clearly is very useful.",

Some of these biologists believe that it will one day be possible to understand how all the nerve cells that make up the brain interact with each other to store memories, carry out problem-solving activities and learn as well as modify behaviour patterns. The study of biology has relevance in almost every aspect of life. It would take far too long to analyse all aspects of the relevance of biology. However, there are some which are undoubtedly of great importance.",

        "chunk_text": "There are a number of things that all of us can do. The first is to recognise that people with AIDS are quite simply sick people who need medical care as well as the support and love of their families and friends. AIDS victims have been stigmatised for years in all countries all over the world. This makes the problem worse in a number of ways: \u2022 It makes it harder for victims to come to terms with their illness. \u2022 It may prevent them from seeking early advice for fear of stigmatisation; this in turn may lead to further infection before the condition is diagnosed. \u2022 It can make governments reluctant to take decisive action for fear of offending powerful pressure groups. We must show tolerance and support. You may one day be in the unenviable position of having to watch someone you love die from a condition that gradually robs them of all ability to look after themselves and turns their body into a shadow of what it was. It could be someone much younger than you, which always seems even worse. People in this position need great strength of character to continue to support the dying person and probably support the rest of the family as well. We need friends to help us through this and we should not forget to help our friends also. The community must pull together: we cannot fight AIDS alone. You will probably have to make some difficult choices about your personal behaviour. Communities are made up of individuals and although communities can agree a course of action, individuals must then support this course of action. Although, as individuals, we can do little about the transmission of AIDS through infected blood products or from mother to child, there are things we can do to help control the spread of AIDS by breaking the transmission pathway. These include: \u2022 Restricting the number of sexual partners. In terms of AIDS, this is simple mathematics. If we have sex with many people, we increase our risk of contracting HIV and then passing it on. Sex within a loving, monogamous relationship limits the spread of AIDS. This will require strength of character as friends may not be prepared to restrict the number of their sexual partners. You should not be swayed and you should try to educate them that their choice is a threat to the health and well-being of the whole community. \u2022 Men can elect to be circumcised. This significantly reduces the risk of men acquiring HIV, although it has little effect on them passing on the virus if they do become infected. \u2022 Not sharing infected needles. Drug users who do this are, again, threatening the well-being of the community, as they may spread the virus from one to another and then into other members of the community through intercourse. You should be aware of all the dangers of the drug habit and make an informed choice that considers not just yourself, but others as well. Remember, community action is always better than individual action. Across Ethiopia, community initiatives and local government are coming together to make a difference in the AIDS response. During a visit to the country, a United Nations AIDS Executive Director visited some of the programmes and projects putting into action the goals of universal access to HIV prevention, treatment, care and support services. The government-run local health centres deliver primary health services such as family health, communicable disease prevention and control, including HIV and health education. Being aware of the advice these centres can offer is crucial in the fight against AIDS.",

These are read by other scientists working in the same field who can repeat the research and comment on any conclusions that have been drawn. \u2022 Any report must contain: \u2013 a title, which states clearly what is being investigated \u2013 a hypothesis, often extended to a prediction for the particular experiment \u2013 a clear description of the experimental procedure \u2013 a full account of the results obtained; it is often helpful to summarise these (where appropriate) in graphs, charts and tables \u2013 the conclusions that have been drawn from the results \u2013 an evaluation of the procedure \u2013 an acknowledgement of the use of any other person\u2019s work \u2022 Biologists use specialised equipment; some apparatus is used mainly in the laboratory, such as: \u2013 microscopes \u2013 centrifuges \u2013 Petri dishes \u2013 measuring cylinders \u2013 balances \u2022 Other apparatus is used mainly in the field, such as: \u2013 quadrats \u2013 plant presses \u2013 theodolites \u2013 GPS receivers \u2013 flow meters \u2022 Biological research is highly relevant to us all because it includes research into: \u2013 producing new crops that will help to feed an increasing world population \u2013 producing new vaccines including, one day, a vaccine against AIDS \u2013 producing new drugs that are more effective in treating diseases \u2013 the environment which will help us to maintain key habitats to prevent species from becoming extinct \u2013 genetic engineering which will offer ways of treating genetic diseases as well as helping to produce genetically engineered crops with a higher yield \u2022 Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) is caused by the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV). \u2022 Africa has the highest incidence of AIDS anywhere in the world. \u2022 HIV can be transmitted by: \u2013 sexual intercourse \u2013 transfusion of infected blood \u2013 drug users sharing infected needles \u2013 from mother to child during pregnancy \u2022 HIV is a retrovirus and is treated by anti-retroviral drugs. \u2022 HAART (Highly Active Anti-Retroviral Therapy) is a combination of anti-retroviral drugs each targeted at a different phase of the HIV life cycle. \u2022 To reduce the spread of AIDS, we should: \u2013 restrict the number of sexual partners \u2013 not share infected needles \u2013 encourage men to be circumcised",

        "topic": "Why is water so important to living things?",
        "chunk_text": "The very first cells on Earth evolved in water about 3.5 billion years ago. Water has many properties that make it important to living things in a number of ways, such as: \u2022 a place to live \u2022 a transport medium \u2022 a reactant in many chemical reactions \u2022 a place for other reactions to take place \u2022 water is a vital chemical constituent of living cells Water is a place to live in. Many organisms live in water. Plants and algae both live in water as do many different types of animals Water is transparent. This means that light can pass through the water and allow the plants and algae to photosynthesise. It also means that animals can see where they are going. However, water does not allow all light to pass through it and as we go deeper and deeper, less and less light penetrates. Different wavelengths of light penetrate to different depths. Red and indigo wavelengths are soon lost. Blue and green wavelengths penetrate deeper than others. Water has a high specific heat capacity. This means that it takes quite a lot of energy to heat water up. Water also loses heat quite slowly. This has the overall effect that water stays more or less the same temperature \u2013 particularly large masses of water, such as oceans and lakes. This is important as the functioning of enzymes in living cells is affected by temperature. Too hot or too cold and the enzymes do not function efficiently and the reactions in the cells controlled by the enzymes are not carried out efficiently. Ice is less dense than liquid water. It is unusual for the solid form of a substance to float on the liquid form of the same substance, but ice floats on water. This is because water expands when it freezes. So, in cold weather, water freezes from the top down. The ice on the surface then acts as an insulator and slows down the heat loss from the liquid water underneath. So life can continue in relatively warm water underneath the ice all through the cold weather. Water has a high latent heat of vaporisation. This means that it takes a lot of energy to turn liquid water into water vapour (or steam). In turn this means that water doesn\u2019t vaporise too easily and that ponds don\u2019t dry up too quickly in hot weather \u2013 and the organisms in the pond have a better chance of survival. This property is also important in temperature control. When we sweat, the energy needed to vaporise the sweat comes from our bodies. This heat is then lost from our bodies and so we cool down. If water vaporised easily, sweating wouldn\u2019t be as effective in controlling our body temperature. Water has a high surface tension. The water molecules in the main body of a mass of water are hydrogen-bonded to other water molecules on all sides. But at the surface, there is no hydrogen bonding above. So the \u2018pull\u2019 from the sides is stronger than it would otherwise be and the molecules at the surface are held together more strongly. This is why some animals can \u2018walk on water\u2019 and why others can attach themselves to the surface of the water and live just below the surface. The water strider in figure 2.10 is just one example of an insect that is so light that the force of the surface tension of the water can support the weight of the insect. The mosquito larvae in figure 2.11 hang from the surface of the water by their breathing tubes. The surface tension is sufficiently strong to hold their weight. Water is a good solvent for many substances Many organic and inorganic substances important to life dissolve in water, but don\u2019t dissolve either at all or as well in other liquids. Water is very versatile. Because these substances dissolve in water, they can be transported in a water-based transport medium. Biological mechanisms such as active transport, diffusion and facilitated diffusion move the substances into and out of the water (in the transport medium). In mammals, the plasma of blood is 90% water. This is forced through the system of veins arteries and capillaries by the heart. In plants water carries dissolved minerals upwards from the roots to other parts of the plants in the xylem vessels. Water in the phloem tubes carries dissolved organic substances all over the plant. Water has the ideal viscosity for a transport medium. Viscosity is a measure of how fluid a liquid is \u2013 how easily it flows. If water were more viscous (less fluid) than it is \u2013 think of tar! \u2013 then the heart would not be able to move it through the blood vessels. Also, the water inside cells transports substances around the cell; if it were more viscous, it would damage the delicate organelles in the cells. If water were less viscous (more fluid) than it is, it would flow too easily and, inside cells, the organelles would not be supported. Similarly, in the circulatory system, a less viscous liquid would not move the blood cells around the system as efficiently.",

Insoluble starch produces none of these effects.\n\u2022 In addition, because amylose and amylopectin are insoluble, the molecules cannot move out of cells \u2013 they remain in storage organs.\n\u2022 The branched nature of amylopectin means that there are many \u2018ends\u2019 to the molecule.

The carboxyl group (the functional group of the fatty acid) is ionic and dissociates in solution to form COO\u2013 and H+ (hydrogen ion).

One egg cannot sit inside another egg because the shapes are the same. The complementary substrate molecule binds with the active site of the enzyme to form the enzyme\u2013substrate complex. The complex causes the reactants to enter a transition state in which the activation energy of the reaction is lowered. The reaction takes place and the products formed are released.

The cofactor combines with the apoenzyme to produce an active enzyme.\nWhere an active enzyme molecule comprises an apoenzyme and a cofactor, the whole is sometimes referred to as the holoenzyme.\nFigure 3.12 shows this.\nCofactors include:\n\u2022 coenzymes\n\u2022 mineral ions\nCoenzymes are organic molecules and many are derived from vitamins. They bind with the enzyme to give catalytic activity.\nSome enzymes can only function in the presence of certain mineral ions. These bind loosely with the enzyme to give it its catalytic activity.

This increases the probability that a substrate particle will collide with an enzyme molecule.\n\u2022 Particles within a molecule vibrate more energetically. This puts strain on the bonds that hold the atoms in place. Bonds begin to break and, in the case of an enzyme, the shape of the molecule, and the active site in particular, begin to change. The enzyme begins to lose its tertiary structure (remember it is a protein) and denature. Figure 3.13 shows this.\nThe activity of an enzyme at a given temperature is a balance between these two effects. If the raised temperature results in little denaturation but a greatly increased number of collisions, the activity of the enzyme will increase. If the higher temperature causes significant denaturation then, despite the extra collisions, the activity of the enzyme will probably decrease. The temperature at which the two effects just balance each other is the optimum temperature for that enzyme. Any further increase in temperature will cause increased denaturation that will outweigh the effects of extra collisions. A decrease in temperature means that fewer collisions will occur. Figure 3.14 shows this. Note that the graph is not symmetrical. Above the optimum temperature, the enzyme denatures very quickly to the point at which the shape of the active site has changed so much that an enzyme\u2013substrate complex cannot form.

Significant changes in pH can affect an enzyme molecule by:\n\u2022 breaking ionic bonds that hold the tertiary structure in place; this leads to denaturation of the enzyme molecule\n\u2022 altering the charge on some of the amino acids that form the active site; this makes it more difficult for substrate molecules to bind\nThese effects occur if the pH becomes either more acidic or more alkaline.

The binding is only temporary and the competitive inhibitor is quickly released. A competitive inhibitor blocks the active site so substrate molecules cannot bind. The overall effect on the rate of reaction depends on the relative concentrations of substrate and inhibitor molecules. Each molecule of competitive inhibitor can inhibit (temporarily) one enzyme molecule \u2013 but only if it can collide with the enzyme molecule and bind with the active site. To do this, it must compete with the substrate molecules for the active site \u2013 hence the name, competitive inhibitor. If there were 99 substrate molecules for every inhibitor molecule, then 99% of the collisions would be between enzyme and substrate and the reaction would proceed at 99% of the maximum rate.

The protein was to form the \u2018bread\u2019 of the sandwich with the phospholipid forming the \u2018filling\u2019. In 1954 they proposed a revised model in which they included protein-lined pores.

As more and more evidence accumulated about how molecules moved across membranes, it became clear that the Davson\u2013Danielli model could not adequately explain all the new evidence. The idea model therefore had to be rejected. In 1972, Singer and Nicholson proposed a totally different arrangement of the phospholipids and proteins in the plasma membrane. They retained the idea of a phospholipid bilayer, but rejected the sandwich arrangement. Instead, they suggested that proteins were \u2018studded\u2019 into the bilayer at different points. They also suggested that the arrangement was not static, but was fluid and constantly changing. Figure 4.21 shows the difference between the Davson\u2013Danielli model and the original fluid mosaic model. As our understanding of processes that occur at the plasma membrane has increased and we have learned more of cell structure and function, the fluid mosaic model has become more sophisticated. Our current idea of membrane structure still assumes this fluid-mosaic nature, but there is now much more detail to the model, as figure 4.22 shows. The key features of the model as we currently understand it are: \u2022 The phospholipid bilayer as the basis for the membrane \u2022 Integral proteins (also known as intrinsic proteins and trans-membrane proteins) that span the membrane. Some of these proteins play an important role in moving substances across the membrane. There are three main types of these transport proteins: \u2013 channel proteins \u2013 these proteins have a channel through them along which a specific ion can pass; there are different channel proteins for different ions \u2013 carrier proteins \u2013 these proteins act in a more sophisticated way to move larger molecules through the membrane by facilitated diffusion or active transport; the ones involved in active transport are often referred to as pumps \u2013 peripheral proteins (also known as extrinsic proteins) that span only one layer (or sometimes less) of the membrane. They have a range of functions; some are enzymes, others anchor integral proteins to the cytoskeleton \u2022 Glycoproteins and glycolipids \u2013 protein and lipid molecules that have carbohydrate chains attached to them and often serve as signals to other cells. They also act as receptor sites for hormones and drugs. The carbohydrate component of each can be cell-specific and so allow identification of the cell by the immune system. \u2022 Cholesterol \u2013 reduces the fluidity of the membrane.",

        "chunk_text": "In fluids \u2013 liquids and gases \u2013 the particles that make up the fluid are free to move around. This kinetic energy is what drives diffusion. If particles are, for some reason, concentrated in a small area, they will move in such a way that the particles \u2018spread out\u2019 and occupy all the space that is available to them. This is a result of random particular motion. Diffusion need not involve a membrane. When particles diffuse across a plasma membrane, there must be a concentration difference between the two sides of the membrane (a concentration gradient) to drive the process. As diffusion proceeds, the high concentration will decrease and the low concentration will increase until the two concentrations are the same. At this point there will be no further net diffusion. This means that although particles will still move across the membrane, they will move equally in both directions, so there will be no overall effect. We say that the concentrations are in equilibrium. Figures 4.24 and 4.25 show this. The rate at which diffusion across a membrane takes place is influenced by: \u2022 the concentration gradient \u2013 a bigger difference in concentration results in faster diffusion than a smaller gradient \u2022 the thickness of the membrane \u2013 as all plasma membranes are the same thickness, this is not really an issue when considering diffusion into and out of cells, but for other situations where particles must cross some kind of barrier, a shorter distance results in faster diffusion \u2022 the surface area of the membrane \u2013 clearly if there is more membrane where diffusion can take place, diffusion will happen faster These features are all related in an equation called Fick\u2019s law of diffusion: Rate of diffusion \u221d Surface area of membrane \u00d7 Concentration difference Diffusion distance The rate of diffusion is also influenced by temperature. Diffusion occurs faster at higher temperatures because the particles have more kinetic energy and so move faster.",

Figure 4.26A shows facilitated diffusion of an ion through an ion pore. Figure 4.26B shows a carrier protein moving particles across a membrane. However, also note that whilst the ions can simply move straight through the ion pore of a channel protein, the carrier protein must undergo a conformational change (change in shape) to move particles through the membrane.

The conditions created in the chloroplast cause the following reaction to occur: 2H O \u2192 O + 4H+ + 4e\u2013 This light-dependent splitting of water is called photolysis. The electrons replace those lost from the chlorophyll molecule. 3. The primary electron acceptor passes the electrons to the next molecule in an electron transport chain (plastoquinone or \u2018Pq\u2019). The electrons then pass along a series of cytochromes (similar to those in the mitochondrial electron transport chain) and finally to plastocyanin (Pc) \u2013 the last carrier in the chain. The electrons lose energy as they are passed from one carrier to the next. 4. One of the molecules in the cytochromes complex is a proton (hydrogen ion) pump. As electrons are transferred to and then transferred from this molecule, the energy they lose powers the pump which moves protons from the stroma of the chloroplast to the space inside the thylakoid. This leads to an accumulation of protons inside the thylakoid, which drives the chemiosmotic synthesis of ATP. 5. Electrons in chlorophyll molecules in photosystem I are excited (as this photosystem absorbs photons of light) and escape from the molecule. They are replaced by the electrons that have passed down the electron transport chain from photosystem II. 6. The electrons then pass along a second electron transport chain involving ferredoxin (Fd) and NADP reductase. At the end of this electron transport chain, they can react with protons (hydrogen ions) and NADP in the stroma of the chloroplast to form reduced NADP. A photosynthetic unit is a unit of pigments, electron carriers and ATP synthase that is capable of carrying out all the reactions in the light-dependent stage of photosynthesis. The formation of ATP in the way described above is called non-cyclic photophosphorylation. This is because: \u2022 the phosphorylation (formation of ATP) is light-dependent \u2022 the electrons lost from the chlorophyll are not recycled in any way Plants sometimes generate ATP by cyclic photophosphorylation. In cyclic photophosphorylation, only photosystem I is used. No oxygen and no reduced NADP are formed. Here, you can see that electrons lost from the chlorophyll molecule are returned to it. Hence the name \u2018cyclic\u2019. This process usually only happens when sugars cannot be synthesised for some reason \u2013 such as lack of carbon dioxide. In cyclic and non-cyclic photophosphorylation, ATP is produced because: \u2022 there is an accumulation of protons (hydrogen ions) in the interior of a thylakoid \u2022 this creates a concentration gradient between the thylakoid interior and the stroma of the chloroplast \u2022 protons move down this concentration gradient, through ATP synthase, causing the rotor to spin, just as in mitochondria during respiration",

The resulting molecules are modified to regenerate the original molecule whilst, at the same time, synthesising glucose. The sequence of reactions was discovered by Melvin Calvin, an American biologist. Because of his work, the light-independent reactions are also referred to as the Calvin cycle. In the 1950s Melvin Calvin experimented with unicellular algae called Chlorella by exposing them to radioactive carbon dioxide. After different periods of time, the algae were killed and the chemicals in the algae that contained radioactive carbon (which must have come from the carbon dioxide) were identified using two-dimensional chromatography. As time passes more compounds contain the radioactive carbon. By refining the experiment and using shorter and shorter intervals, Calvin identified the first stable compound to be formed as a compound containing three carbon atoms called glycerate phosphate (GP). The main stages of the light-independent reactions are: \u2022 carbon dioxide reacts with ribulose bisphosphate (RuBP) \u2013 a five-carbon compound in the stroma; the reaction is catalysed by the enzyme Rubisco. \u2022 two molecules of the three-carbon compound GP are formed from this reaction \u2022 each molecule of GP is converted to TP (triose phosphate \u2013 another three-carbon compound); this is a reduction reaction using hydrogen ions from reduced NADP and energy from ATP \u2022 some of the TP formed is used to regenerate the RuBP (ATP is again required) whilst some is used to form glucose and other useful organic compounds.

        "chunk_text": "What we have just described is the method of photosynthesis that takes place in plants living in temperate environments, such as those found in Europe. It is called C3 photosynthesis \u2013 because the first compound formed in the light-independent reactions of the Calvin cycle is GP, which contains three carbon atoms. C3 plants have leaves that are adapted to this method of photosynthesis. These leaves are generally broad, to catch as much sunlight as possible.",

        "chunk_text": "The cells that contain most chloroplasts (the palisade cells) are nearest the upper surface of the leaf (to absorb as much light as possible). The stomata are mainly on the lower surface, to minimise water loss. During the day, the stomata are open for most of the time to allow the entry of carbon dioxide, but they can be closed if the water loss is too great on a hot day. The spongy mesophyll has air spaces that allow easy diffusion of carbon dioxide and oxygen between the palisade layer and the stomata. However, plants in the tropics have a problem. Here, it can be very hot and the leaves close their stomata to minimise water loss. When C3 plants do this, the concentration of carbon dioxide in the leaves falls and the enzyme Rubisco starts to behave in an unusual way. In the low concentrations of carbon dioxide, Rubisco binds with oxygen, not carbon dioxide. This means that RuBP is oxidised to one molecule of GP (not two) and a molecule of phosphoglycolate. In addition, carbon dioxide is produced in the process. The process is called photorespiration because it involves oxidation of carbon. Rubisco Ribulose bisphosphate + oxygen GP + phosphoglycolate The one molecule of GP formed in photorespiration can re-enter the Calvin cycle, but the phosphoglycolate must be converted into GP for use in the Calvin cycle by a complex series of reactions. It is not necessary to try to remember all these reactions. Instead, think of the two phases of photorespiration: 1. Rubisco catalyses a reaction between oxygen and RuBP to form one molecule of GP (not two) and one molecule of phosphoglycolate. 2. The phosphoglycolate is converted to GP in reactions in the chloroplast, peroxisome and mitochondrion. Photorespiration reduces the efficiency of photosynthesis for several reasons, including: \u2022 the carbon is oxidised, which is the reverse of photosynthesis \u2013 the reduction of carbon to carbohydrate \u2022 the ribulose bisphosphate must be resynthesised and the phosphoglycolate removed \u2022 ATP is used in the resynthesis of RuBP.",

        "chunk_text": "To get round the problem of photorespiration reducing the efficiency of photosynthesis, plants that grow in tropical areas like Ethiopia (such as maize, crabgrass, sorghum and sugar cane) have evolved a different photosynthetic pathway called C4 photosynthesis. As the name suggests, the first compound formed in the light-independent reactions is a C4 compound (contains four carbon atoms) not GP (a C3 compound). The light-dependent reactions are the same as in the C3 plants, but there is a difference in how glucose is synthesised in the light-independent reactions. The structure is essentially similar to that of a C3 plant, but there is one important difference. The cells of the bundle sheath contain chloroplasts, which they don\u2019t in C3 plants. Having no thylakoids means that the light-dependent reactions cannot occur here and so oxygen is not produced in these chloroplasts. This helps to prevent photorespiration and allows the Calvin cycle to take place in these cells. The light-dependent reactions in the C4 pathway also involve a set of reactions not found in C3 plants. These reactions take place in the mesophyll cells, which have chloroplasts with thylakoids and so can carry out the light-dependent reactions. However, they do not have the enzymes to catalyse the reactions of the Calvin cycle. Instead, the following reactions take place: 1. Carbon dioxide reacts with a C3 compound called PEP to form the C4 compound oxaloacetate. This is catalysed by the enzyme PEP carboxylase. 2. Oxaloacetate is converted into another C4 compound (malate), which then passes from the mesophyll cell into a bundle sheath cell.",
