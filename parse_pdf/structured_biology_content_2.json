        "chunk_text": "Biology is the science of life and living organisms. You know from earlier studies that an organism is a living being made from one cell (for example bacteria, unicellular algae) or many cells (for example, animals, plants and most fungi).\nWhen we think of biologists, we often have quite a narrow view of what they do. But, just as all chemists don\u2019t wear white coats, all biologists don\u2019t look down microscopes in laboratories. Here are just a few of the areas of biological study.\nSome biologists become astrobiologists. These biologists engage in all kinds of research to try to find evidence of life on other planets in our Solar System and in galaxies elsewhere in the Universe.\nOther biologists take part in biomedical research. These biologists help in many areas, including the development of new drugs and vaccines. They also study the ways in which diseases develop to gain a better understanding of them so that cures can be found.\nOthers still become microbiologists. These biologists study how micro-organisms of all kinds function. Some micro-organisms cause disease, and understanding how they work makes a treatment more likely. Many microbiologists are studying the human immuno-deficiency virus (HIV) to get a better understanding of how AIDS develops and how it can be treated.\nPaleobiology is a fascinating area of study to many people. Paleobiologists try to find out more about the way in which life began on Earth and how it has evolved from simple life forms into more complex ones. They use evidence from fossils and from studies of the chemistry of ancient rocks to make estimates of when and how new life forms appeared on the planet.\nMany different biologists are involved in the Human Genome Project. This enormous project has produced the first ever map of the 46 chromosomes found in human cells. It has located the tens of thousands of genes and has determined the exact structure of each chromosome. Although the \u2018map\u2019 is finished, there is still much to be found out. Analysis will continue for many years to come.\nBesides these biologists, there are others who are, perhaps, more recognisable. These include: doctors, dentists, veterinary surgeons, nurses, physiotherapists, botanists, zoologists, physiologists, biochemists, agricultural biologists, ecologists, ethologists, entomologists, geneticists, oncologists, neurobiologists, parasitologists . . . \n. . . and many, many others besides.",

For centuries, people based their explanations of what they saw going on in the world around them on observations, without testing their ideas to see if they were true. One ancient belief was that simple living organisms could come into being by spontaneous generation. This idea suggests that non-living objects can give rise to living organisms. As an example: \u2022 Observation: Every year in the spring, the river Nile flooded areas of Egypt leaving behind mud containing many nutrients that enabled the people to grow that year\u2019s crop. However, along with the muddy soil, large numbers of frogs appeared that weren\u2019t around in drier times. \u2022 Conclusion: Muddy soil gives rise to frogs! Also, before the invention of the refrigerator, animal carcasses were hung by the heels in butcher\u2019s shops and people would ask the butcher to cut off the part they wanted. The shop was always full of flies. So people believed that the meat had turned into flies! Because of these and other observations, many people, including quite eminent \u2018scientists\u2019 of the day, produced recipes for \u2018creating\u2019 life from non-living objects.

The factor that the scientist changes, or manipulates, is called the independent variable (or IV for short). The factor that the scientist measures to see if it changes when the IV is changed is called the dependent variable (or DV for short). The scientist will want to find out if changes in the independent variable produce changes in the dependent variable. In the example on pages 5 and 6, the independent variable was the presence or absence of tomato juice. The dependent variable was the number of tomato seeds germinating. To prove cause and effect \u2013 to prove that it is changes in the IV (and nothing else) that are causing changes in the DV \u2013 we must take all the steps we can to ensure that the experiment is a fair test. We must make sure that any other factors which could affect the results are the same for the different conditions we set up. In the tomato seed example, if one group of seeds had been at a higher temperature than the other group, this could have made them germinate faster. We wouldn\u2019t have known whether it was the tomato juice affecting the results or the temperature. Our experiment would not be valid. So we must keep constant anything other than the IV that might influence the results. These are controlled variables. In the tomato seed experiment, the controlled variables were: \u2022 temperature \u2022 lighting conditions \u2022 number of seeds per dish, and \u2022 volume of liquid added (water or tomato juice). Occasionally, there is a variable that might influence the results that you can\u2019t control. Such a variable is a confounding variable. This is because it \u2018confounds\u2019 the interpretation of the results. You couldn\u2019t be certain that it was the IV producing the changes in the DV because of the presence of the confounding variable. For example, if you measure the carbon dioxide uptake by wheat plants as the light intensity changes over the day, you cannot control the effect of change in temperature.

All these are used for measuring volumes, usually of liquids, but in some investigations they can be used to measure the volume of a gas. In this example, an upturned measuring cylinder is being used to collect oxygen gas produced when yeast converts hydrogen peroxide into water and oxygen. Some syringes are designed specifically as \u2018gas syringes\u2019 and could be used as an alternative way of collecting the oxygen in the above experiment. Balances are used for measuring mass. They come in a range of sizes and properties. Some can measure the mass of very heavy objects, but not with any great degree of precision. Others measure smaller masses to the nearest 0.0001 g (one ten-thousandth of a gram). Sometimes biologists need to dissect specimens to find out what they are like inside. This need not always mean dissecting a whole organism. Quite often, students dissect organs, such as the heart or the kidney, to find out about their structure. Biologists may dissect owl pellets \u2013 these are pellets containing the parts of food that the owl has eaten and that cannot be digested and have been regurgitated. Dissecting these can give information about what the bird has been eating. Petri dishes are round dishes made from glass or from plastic. They are used in many different ways, but usually to culture some organisms. They are often filled with a \u2018jelly\u2019 called agar and used to culture bacteria. There are many different agars containing different balances of nutrients. Each type of agar can encourage the growth of different bacteria. By marking a grid on the surface of the Petri dish, biologists can estimate how much of the dish is covered by bacteria and then use this to estimate how fast the bacteria are growing. Petri dishes are also used to propagate or culture plants. The small \u2018plantlets\u2019 or \u2018explants\u2019 in figure 1.14 have been grown on a special agar from just a few plant cells. They will grow roots and then shoots and leaves. When they are big enough, they will be transplanted into pots of soil or compost and grown into mature plants. Petri dishes can also be used to: \u2022 show how effective different antibiotics are against certain types of bacteria \u2022 show how well different concentrations of enzymes digest a substance As you know already from your study in grade 9, microscopes are one of the most vital tools in a biology laboratory.

        "chunk_text": "Biologists do a lot of work outside the laboratory. They study different areas to find out how the animals, plants and micro-organisms interact with each other and with the environment. They find out how an area changes over time and how it is influenced by human activity. All this involves: \u2022 taking measurements of the abundance of organisms in the field \u2022 taking samples of the environment (for example, soil, rocks, water) for analysis in the laboratory \u2022 collecting specimens for identification and analysis in the laboratory To gain an estimate of the abundance of organisms in an area, biologists often use quadrats. There are many different types, but the simplest is just a metal square. It is placed randomly on the ground and the organisms found inside it are counted and the numbers and types recorded. This data can be used to make an estimate of the abundance of the organisms in the area. Figure 1.20 shows students recording the contents of a quadrat. The use of quadrats is not confined to sites on land. They can be used underwater also! Biologists also use quadrats to show how the numbers of a particular species changes across an area. To do this, they lay down a tape measure (or a long rope marked off every metre) across the area. This is called a transect line. They then place the quadrat by the side of the transect line and record the abundance of the organisms in the quadrat. They repeat this every metre, or every 5 or 10 metres, depending on the length of the transect. This gives a picture of how the abundance of each species changes across the area. To collect specimens for identification in the laboratory, biologists use a range of equipment. Collecting plants is relatively easy, if they are not too large. Small parts (for example, leaves and flowers) can be collected and kept in reasonable condition for a short period in plastic jars or plastic bags. Parts of plants can also be preserved using a plant press. This preserves the shape and form of the plant parts for some time and specimens can be analysed later. Whole plants can be dug up and replanted for study in the laboratory. However, animals pose a different problem. Because they move, they must be caught. Biologists do this in many different ways. Some insects can be caught using nets like the ones shown in frrigure 1.22. Others are caught using pitfall traps \u2013 see page 22.",

If enough people in an area are immune, the micro-organism causing the disease cannot easily spread to an uninfected person and so the disease is eliminated.Biologists have developed drugs that target and aim to break this life cycle. They are called anti-retroviral drugs. There are different anti-retroviral drugs that target different stages in the life cycle. They are more effective when taken in combination than when taken singly, although there can be side effects. The combination treatment is called highly active anti-retroviral therapy, or HAART. However, it is important to remember that these drugs only treat the HIV that is currently present in the body. They do not provide any lasting immunity and a person could be reinfected.Other biologists have been working for years to try to produce a vaccine against HIV. A vaccine would provide lasting immunity against reinfection by HIV. One of the problems has been that HIV mutates (changes) rapidly and that any one infected person can have several different types of HIV in them. However, researchers have found a part of the virus that is found in all strains of HIV and is crucial to the virus infecting the cells. They have constructed a vaccine based on this. Their research is also unusual because they have attached this part of HIV to a common cold virus. Previously most experimental AIDS vaccines had been based on a weakened form of HIV itself and were potentially dangerous because the virus could always revert to its infective form. Also, other biologists are studying a group of people in Kenya who have been repeatedly exposed to HIV but never developed AIDS. Their immune responses to HIV may hold the key to a vaccine. It has been shown that human antibodies produced against HIV completely protect some monkeys against a very similar disease caused by a very similar virus. A vaccine could well be possible.",

        "chunk_text": "There are a number of things that all of us can do. The first is to recognise that people with AIDS are quite simply sick people who need medical care as well as the support and love of their families and friends. AIDS victims have been stigmatised for years in all countries all over the world. This makes the problem worse in a number of ways:\n\u2022 It makes it harder for victims to come to terms with their illness.\n\u2022 It may prevent them from seeking early advice for fear of stigmatisation; this in turn may lead to further infection before the condition is diagnosed.\n\u2022 It can make governments reluctant to take decisive action for fear of offending powerful pressure groups.\nWe must show tolerance and support. You may one day be in the unenviable position of having to watch someone you love die from a condition that gradually robs them of all ability to look after themselves and turns their body into a shadow of what it was. It could be someone much younger than you, which always seems even worse. People in this position need great strength of character to continue to support the dying person and probably support the rest of the family as well. We need friends to help us through this and we should not forget to help our friends also. The community must pull together: we cannot fight AIDS alone.\nYou will probably have to make some difficult choices about your personal behaviour. Communities are made up of individuals and although communities can agree a course of action, individuals must then support this course of action.\nAlthough, as individuals, we can do little about the transmission of AIDS through infected blood products or from mother to child, there are things we can do to help control the spread of AIDS by breaking the transmission pathway. These include:\n\u2022 Restricting the number of sexual partners. In terms of AIDS, this is simple mathematics.

        "chunk_text": "The very first cells on Earth evolved in water about 3.5 billion years ago. Water has many properties that make it important to living things in a number of ways, such as:\n\u2022 a place to live\n\u2022 a transport medium\n\u2022 a reactant in many chemical reactions\n\u2022 a place for other reactions to take place\n\u2022 water is a vital chemical constituent of living cells\nWater is a place to live in. Many organisms live in water. Plants and algae both live in water as do many different types of animals\nWater is transparent. This means that light can pass through the water and allow the plants and algae to photosynthesise. It also means that animals can see where they are going. However, water does not allow all light to pass through it and as we go deeper and deeper, less and less light penetrates.\nDifferent wavelengths of light penetrate to different depths. Red and indigo wavelengths are soon lost. Blue and green wavelengths penetrate deeper than others.\nWater has a high specific heat capacity. This means that it takes quite a lot of energy to heat water up. Water also loses heat quite slowly. This has the overall effect that water stays more or less the same temperature \u2013 particularly large masses of water, such as oceans and lakes. This is important as the functioning of enzymes in living cells is affected by temperature. Too hot or too cold and the enzymes do not function efficiently and the reactions in the cells controlled by the enzymes are not carried out efficiently.\nIce is less dense than liquid water. It is unusual for the solid form of a substance to float on the liquid form of the same substance, but ice floats on water. This is because water expands when it freezes. So, in cold weather, water freezes from the top down. The ice on the surface then acts as an insulator and slows down the heat loss from the liquid water underneath. So life can continue in relatively warm water underneath the ice all through the cold weather.\nWater has a high latent heat of vaporisation. This means that it takes a lot of energy to turn liquid water into water vapour (or steam). In turn this means that water doesn\u2019t vaporise too easily and that ponds don\u2019t dry up too quickly in hot weather \u2013 and the organisms in the pond have a better chance of survival. This property is also important in temperature control.\nWhen we sweat, the energy needed to vaporise the sweat comes from our bodies. This heat is then lost from our bodies and so we cool down. If water vaporised easily, sweating wouldn\u2019t be as effective in controlling our body temperature.\nWater has a high surface tension. The water molecules in the main body of a mass of water are hydrogen-bonded to other water molecules on all sides. But at the surface, there is no hydrogen bonding above. So the \u2018pull\u2019 from the sides is stronger than it would otherwise be and the molecules at the surface are held together more strongly.\nThis is why some animals can \u2018walk on water\u2019 and why others can attach themselves to the surface of the water and live just below the surface. The water strider is just one example of an insect that is so light that the force of the surface tension of the water water can support the weight of the insect. The mosquito larvae hang from the surface of the water by their breathing tubes. The surface tension is sufficiently strong to hold their weight.\nWater is a good solvent for many substances Many organic and inorganic substances important to life dissolve in water, but don\u2019t dissolve either at all or as well in other liquids. Water is very versatile. Because these substances dissolve in water, they can be transported in a water-based transport medium. Biological mechanisms such as active transport, diffusion and facilitated diffusion move the substances into and out of the water (in the transport medium). In mammals, the plasma of blood is 90% water. This is forced through the system of veins arteries and capillaries by the heart. In plants water carries dissolved minerals upwards from the roots to other parts of the plants in the xylem vessels. Water in the phloem tubes carries dissolved organic substances all over the plant.\nWater has the ideal viscosity for a transport medium. Viscosity is a measure of how fluid a liquid is \u2013 how easily it flows. If water were more viscous (less fluid) than it is \u2013 think of tar! \u2013 then the heart would not be able to move it through the blood vessels. Also, the water inside cells transports substances around the cell; if it were more viscous, it would damage the delicate organelles in the cells. If water were less viscous (more fluid) than it is, it would flow too easily and, inside cells, the organelles would not be supported. Similarly, in the circulatory system, a less viscous liquid would not move the blood cells around the system as efficiently.",

In this configuration, the hydrophilic heads face outwards into the water and the hydrophobic tails face inwards, away from the water. Phospholipid bilayers are the basis of plasma membranes. We will study these in detail in unit 4. Notice how the structure of a phospholipid has been simplified in figure 2.33. The phosphate head is shown as a ball and the fatty acids as two tails.

        "chunk_text": "Proteins are extremely important substances that are needed to form all living cells. Their molecules contain the elements carbon, hydrogen and oxygen (like carbohydrates and lipids), but they also contain nitrogen and most contain sulphur. Protein molecules are polymers of amino acids and so are macromolecules also. But they vary enormously in size; the smallest protein molecules contain fewer than 100 amino acids, whilst the largest contain several thousand. Proteins have a range of functions; they are important in: \u2022 the structure of plasma membranes \u2013 protein molecules form ion channels, transport proteins and surface receptors for hormones, neurotransmitters and other molecules \u2022 the immune system \u2013 antigen and antibody molecules are proteins\n\u2022 the control of metabolism by enzymes \u2013 all enzymes are proteins\n\u2022 the structure of chromosomes \u2013 DNA is wound around molecules of the protein histone to form a chromosome\nAll amino acid molecules are built around a carbon atom (the \u03b1-carbon) to which is attached: \u2022 a hydrogen atom \u2022 an amino group (\u2013NH2) \u2022 a carboxyl group (\u2013COOH) \u2022 an \u2018R\u2019 group, which represents the other atoms in the molecule, such as a single hydrogen atom, a hydrocarbon chain or a more complex structure\nTwo amino acids can be joined together by condensation to form a dipeptide. This takes place in much the same way as when two monosaccharides join to form a disaccharide. H and OH are lost to create a molecule of water. The \u2018H\u2019 is lost from the amino group on one amino acid and the \u2018OH\u2019 is lost from the carboxyl group on the other amino acid. \u2018Spare bonds\u2019 are created on each molecule, which then join to form a peptide bond, which holds the two amino acids together. This is shown in figure 2.35.\nA dipeptide can be enlarged into a polypeptide by condensation with more amino acid molecules. Many amino acids joined by peptide bonds form a polypeptide chain; this sequence of amino acids is the primary structure of the protein. Once formed, the polypeptide chain folds itself into a secondary structure, which is either an \u03b1-helix or a \u03b2-pleated sheet (see figure 2.36). The structures are held in place by hydrogen bonds that form between peptide bonds in adjacent parts of the amino acid chain. Both types of secondary structure can exist in different regions of the same polypeptide chain. A protein molecule can also have a tertiary structure. This involves further folding of the secondary structure and the formation of new bonds to hold the tertiary structure in place. These new bonds include: \u2022 more hydrogen bonds \u2013 between the R-groups of some amino acids \u2022 disulphide bridges \u2013 between amino acids that contain sulphur \u2022 ionic bonds \u2013 between amino acids with positively charged R-groups and those with negatively charged R-groups\nEach protein has a unique tertiary structure and so has a unique configuration (shape) because: \u2022 the primary structure of each protein is coded for by DNA, which determines the type and position of each amino acid in the polypeptide chain",

The protein was to form the \u2018bread\u2019 of the sandwich with the phospholipid forming the \u2018filling\u2019. In 1954 they proposed a revised model in which they included protein-lined pores.

The idea model therefore had to be rejected. \nIn 1972, Singer and Nicholson proposed a totally different arrangement of the phospholipids and proteins in the plasma membrane. They retained the idea of a phospholipid bilayer, but rejected the sandwich arrangement. Instead, they suggested that proteins were \u2018studded\u2019 into the bilayer at different points.

As diffusion proceeds, the high concentration will decrease and the low concentration will increase until the two concentrations are the same. At this point there will be no further net diffusion.

Whereas the reactions of the link reaction and Krebs cycle take place in the fluid matrix of the mitochondrion, the reactions of the electron transport chain and chemiosmosis take place on the inner mitochondrial membrane. On the cristae, the following events take place: \u2022 the hydrogen atoms carried by reduced NAD and reduced FAD are released and split into protons (hydrogen ions) and electrons \u2022 the electrons pass along a series of electron carriers that form the transport chain; they lose energy as they pass from one carrier to the next \u2022 three of the electron carriers are proton pumps that move protons from the matrix of the mitochondrion to the inter-membrane space \u2022 as the electrons are transferred through these three proton pumps, the energy they lose powers the pumps which move the protons into the inter-membrane space \u2022 electrons from reduced NAD make this happen at all three pumps The molecules that act as electron carriers in the electron transport chain are: \u2022 reduced NAD dehydrogenase (also a proton pump) \u2022 ubiquinone (also a proton pump), and \u2022 a number of carriers called cytochromes (these are proteins that contain iron); two of them form a complex that acts as the third proton pump. At the end of the electron transport chain, the electrons combine with protons and with oxygen to form molecules of water. Because of this, oxygen is known as the terminal electron acceptor. Whereas reduced NAD is dehydrogenated by the NAD dehydrogenase complex, reduced FAD is dehydrogenated by ubiquinone. So electrons from reduced FAD only operate two of the three proton pumps. Because of the action of the proton pumps, protons accumulate in the inter-membrane space creating a higher concentration there than in the matrix (on the other side of the membrane). This proton gradient results in protons diffusing through the ATP synthase molecule (down the concentration gradient) making the synthase rotor \u2018spin\u2019 and produce ATP from ADP and P. The diffusion of hydrogen ions through the ATP synthase is chemiosmosis. The oxidation of one molecule of reduced NAD results in six protons passing through ATP synthase and so leads to the synthesis of three molecules of ATP. The oxidation of one molecule of reduced FAD results in four protons passing through ATP synthase and so leads to the synthesis of just two molecules of ATP. By adding up the number of molecules of ATP produced, the model of aerobic respiration we have discussed predicts that there will be a net yield of 38 molecules of ATP per molecule of glucose.

If the electron transport chain does not function, NAD is not regenerated from reduced NAD and FAD is not regenerated from reduced FAD. Very quickly, the Krebs cycle and the link reaction come to a halt as both NAD and FAD are required in their oxidised forms for the Krebs cycle to function. NAD is also required in the link reaction and so this comes to a halt also. However, glycolysis can continue even though it also requires NAD. This is because the reduced NAD formed during glycolysis can be regenerated under anaerobic conditions by converting the pyruvate into another product in a reduction reaction. Reduced NAD supplies the hydrogen for this reduction and becomes oxidised itself. It is therefore regenerated and can be used again in glycolysis.

The conditions created in the chloroplast cause the following reaction to occur: 2H O \u2192 O + 4H+ + 4e\u2013 This light-dependent splitting of water is called photolysis. The electrons replace those lost from the chlorophyll molecule. 3. The primary electron acceptor passes the electrons to the next molecule in an electron transport chain (plastoquinone or \u2018Pq\u2019). The electrons then pass along a series of cytochromes (similar to those in the mitochondrial electron transport chain) and finally to plastocyanin (Pc) \u2013 the last carrier in the chain. The electrons lose energy as they are passed from one carrier to the next. 4. One of the molecules in the cytochromes complex is a proton (hydrogen ion) pump. As electrons are transferred to and then transferred from this molecule, the energy they lose powers the pump which moves protons from the stroma of the chloroplast to the space inside the thylakoid. This leads to an accumulation of protons inside the thylakoid, which drives the chemiosmotic synthesis of ATP. 5. Electrons in chlorophyll molecules in photosystem I are excited (as this photosystem absorbs photons of light) and escape from the molecule. They are replaced by the electrons that have passed down the electron transport chain from photosystem II. 6. The electrons then pass along a second electron transport chain involving ferredoxin (Fd) and NADP reductase. At the end The main events in the light-dependent reactions are summarised in figure 5.32.",

They comprise a complex cycle of reactions that involves the addition of carbon dioxide to a preexisting five-carbon molecule (a molecule containing five carbon atoms) within the chloroplast. The resulting molecules are modified to regenerate the original molecule whilst, at the same time, synthesising glucose. The sequence of reactions was discovered by Melvin Calvin, an American biologist. Because of his work, the light-independent reactions are also referred to as the Calvin cycle.\nThe main stages of the light-independent reactions are:\n\u2022 carbon dioxide reacts with ribulose bisphosphate (RuBP) \u2013 a five-carbon compound in the stroma; the reaction is catalysed by the enzyme Rubisco.\n\u2022 two molecules of the three-carbon compound GP are formed from this reaction as figure 5.36 shows\n\u2022 each molecule of GP is converted to TP (triose phosphate \u2013 another three-carbon compound); this is a reduction reaction using hydrogen ions from reduced NADP and energy from ATP\n\u2022 some of the TP formed is used to regenerate the RuBP (ATP is again required) whilst some is used to form glucose and other useful organic compounds\nFigure 5.37 summarises the light-independent reactions of photosynthesis. It shows how three \u2018turns of the cycle\u2019 result in an output of one molecule of TP. Six turns of the cycle would give an output of two molecules of TP \u2013 enough to make one molecule of glucose.\nTP can also be converted to lipids, amino acids and from these into nucleotides and all the other organic molecules found in plants.

        "topic": "C3 photosynthesis and photorespiration",
        "chunk_text": "What we have just described is the method of photosynthesis that takes place in plants living in temperate environments, such as those found in Europe. It is called C3 photosynthesis \u2013 because the first compound formed in the light-independent reactions of the Calvin cycle is GP, which contains three carbon atoms. C3 plants have leaves that are adapted to this method of photosynthesis. These leaves are generally broad, to catch as much sunlight as possible. The cells that contain most chloroplasts (the palisade cells) are nearest the upper surface of the leaf (to absorb as much light as possible). The stomata are mainly on the lower surface, to minimise water loss. During the day, the stomata are open for most of the time to allow the entry of carbon dioxide, but they can be closed if the water loss is too great on a hot day. The spongy mesophyll has air spaces that allow easy diffusion of carbon dioxide and oxygen between the palisade layer and the stomata. However, plants in the tropics have a problem. Here, it can be very hot and the leaves close their stomata to minimise water loss. When C3 plants do this, the concentration of carbon dioxide in the leaves falls and the enzyme Rubisco starts to behave in an unusual way. In the low concentrations of carbon dioxide, Rubisco binds with oxygen, not carbon dioxide. This means that RuBP is oxidised to one molecule of GP (not two) and a molecule of phosphoglycolate. In addition, carbon dioxide is produced in the process. The process is called photorespiration because it involves oxidation of carbon. The one molecule of GP formed in photorespiration can re-enter the Calvin cycle, but the phosphoglycolate must be converted into GP for use in the Calvin cycle by a complex series of reactions. These reactions (involving a chloroplast, an organelle called a peroxisome and a mitochondrion) are summarised in figure 5.46 It is not necessary to try to remember all these reactions. Instead, think of the two phases of photorespiration: 1. Rubisco catalyses a reaction between oxygen and RuBP to form one molecule of GP (not two) and one molecule of phosphoglycolate. 2. The phosphoglycolate is converted to GP in reactions in the chloroplast, peroxisome and mitochondrion. Photorespiration reduces the efficiency of photosynthesis for several reasons, including: \u2022 the carbon is oxidised, which is the reverse of photosynthesis \u2013 the reduction of carbon to carbohydrate \u2022 the ribulose bisphosphate must be resynthesised and the phosphoglycolate removed \u2022 ATP is used in the resynthesis of RuBP.",

        "chunk_text": "To get round the problem of photorespiration reducing the efficiency of photosynthesis, plants that grow in tropical areas like Ethiopia (such as maize, crabgrass, sorghum and sugar cane) have evolved a different photosynthetic pathway called C4 photosynthesis. As the name suggests, the first compound formed in the light-independent reactions is a C4 compound (contains four carbon atoms) not GP (a C3 compound). The light-dependent reactions are the same as in the C3 plants, but there is a difference in how glucose is synthesised in the light-independent reactions. First, look at the structure of the leaf of a C4 plant in figure 5.47. The structure is essentially similar to that of a C3 plant, but there is one important difference. The cells of the bundle sheath contain chloroplasts, which they don\u2019t in C3 plants. Having no thylakoids means that the light-dependent reactions cannot occur here and so oxygen is not produced in these chloroplasts. This helps to prevent photorespiration and allows the Calvin cycle to take place in these cells. The light-dependent reactions in the C4 pathway also involve a set of reactions not found in C3 plants. These reactions take place in the mesophyll cells, which have chloroplasts with thylakoids and so can carry out the light-dependent reactions. However, they do not have the enzymes to catalyse the reactions of the Calvin cycle. Instead, the following reactions take place: 1. Carbon dioxide reacts with a C3 compound called PEP to form the C4 compound oxaloacetate. This is catalysed by the enzyme PEP carboxylase. 2. Oxaloacetate is converted into another C4 compound (malate), which then passes from the mesophyll cell into a bundle sheath cell.",
