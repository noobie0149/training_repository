        "chunk_text": "Biology is the science of life and living organisms. You know from earlier studies that an organism is a living being made from one cell (for example bacteria, unicellular algae) or many cells (for example, animals, plants and most fungi). When we think of biologists, we often have quite a narrow view of what they do. But, just as all chemists don't wear white coats, all biologists don't look down microscopes in laboratories. Here are just a few of the areas of biological study. Some biologists become astrobiologists. These biologists engage in all kinds of research to try to find evidence of life on other planets in our Solar System and in galaxies elsewhere in the Universe. Other biologists take part in biomedical research. These biologists help in many areas, including the development of new drugs and vaccines. They also study the ways in which diseases develop to gain a better understanding of them so that cures can be found. Others still become microbiologists. These biologists study how micro-organisms of all kinds function. Some micro-organisms cause disease, and understanding how they work makes a treatment more likely. Many microbiologists are studying the human immuno-deficiency virus (HIV) to get a better understanding of how AIDS develops and how it can be treated. Paleobiology is a fascinating area of study to many people. Paleobiologists try to find out more about the way in which life began on Earth and how it has evolved from simple life forms into more complex ones. They use evidence from fossils and from studies of the chemistry of ancient rocks to make estimates of when and how new life forms appeared on the planet. Many different biologists are involved in the Human Genome Project. This enormous project has produced the first ever map of the46 chromosomes found in human cells. It has located the tens of thousands of genes and has determined the exact structure of each chromosome. Although the 'map' is finished, there is still much to be found out. Analysis will continue for many years to come. Besides these biologists, there are others who are, perhaps, more recognisable. These include: doctors, dentists, veterinary surgeons, nurses, physiotherapists, botanists, zoologists, physiologists, biochemists, agricultural biologists, ecologists, ethologists, entomologists, geneticists, oncologists, neurobiologists, parasitologists . . . . . . and many, many others besides.",

        "chunk_text": "The word science comes from the Latin word scientia, which means 'knowledge'. But science isn't just about having knowledge: science is a unique system of acquiring knowledge based on the scientific method. This science is sometimes called experimental science, because it depends very heavily on experimentation to obtain the information. This is different from applied science, in which scientific research is used to meet certain human needs. However, it is often difficult to separate the two. Science is an ongoing effort to find new information and principles which can increase human knowledge and understanding. In their research, scientists collect evidence that supports or disproves a particular suggested explanation of a natural phenomenon. One important idea in science is that any suggested explanation of a phenomenon should be capable of being proved wrong. If there is no way of proving it wrong, how can other people accept that it is correct? This is what distinguishes science from religious beliefs.",

For centuries, people based their explanations of what they saw going on in the world around them on observations, without testing their ideas to see if they were true. One ancient belief was that simple living organisms could come into being by spontaneous generation. This idea suggests that non-living objects can give rise to living organisms. As an example: Observation: Every year in the spring, the river Nile flooded areas of Egypt leaving behind mud containing many nutrients that enabled the people to grow that year's crop. However, along with the muddy soil, large numbers of frogs appeared that weren't around in drier times. Conclusion: Muddy soil gives rise to frogs! Also, before the invention of the refrigerator, animal carcasses were hung by the heels in butcher's shops and people would ask the butcher to cut off the part they wanted. The shop was always full of flies. So people believed that the meat had turned into flies! Because of these and other observations, many people, including quite eminent 'scientists' of the day, produced recipes for 'creating' life from non-living objects. It took the work of Louis Pasteur using the proper scientific method to finally disprove this myth.",

What is the biologist doing and what do we mean by hypothesis? To help you understand what is happening at each stage of the scientific method, an example using the growth of a tomato seed is detailed below. Step of the method What happens at this step Ask a question Something catches our imagination. We know that tomato seeds germinate when they are planted. But, why don't tomato seeds grow inside tomatoes? Do background research Before we start trying to do the whole investigation ourselves, we will first check scientific magazines and the internet to see if anyone else has looked into the problem, or into a similar problem. We find out that there are substances in plants that control growth, called growth regulators. Construct hypothesis 'There are chemicals in tomatoes that stop the seeds from growing whilst they are still in the tomatoes themselves.' This hypothesis is testable by an experiment. We think that it is a chemical that is responsible. So how do we prove that? We could try covering some seeds with tomato juice and others with water and see if any germinate. Based on our hypothesis, we can make a prediction: 'Seeds covered in tomato juice will not germinate as well as seeds covered in water'. Design and carry out an experiment to test the hypothesis1. Put several tomatoes in a blender. 2. Filter (strain) the blended material through some muslin. 3. Collect the tomato seeds and wash them in distilled water. 4. Place20 in a Petri dish on filter paper and cover them with the tomato juice obtained from filtering the tomatoes. 5. Place20 in a Petri dish on filter paper and cover them with the same volume of distilled water. 6. Place them in a growth cabinet that will keep the temperature and lighting conditions constant. 7. Leave them for four days. 8. Check the number that have germinated in each condition. 9. Repeat the experiment50 times to confirm your results. Analyse results and draw conclusions Out of1000 seeds sown in each condition, 668 germinated in the distilled water (13.36 per dish) and265 germinated in the tomato juice (5.3 per dish). It seems like something in the tomato juice is affecting the germination of the seeds. It can't be the cells themselves, because they were filtered off. It must be a chemical in the juice. Accept or reject the hypothesis It seems as though the hypothesis is along the right lines; the tomato juice will only contain chemicals, not cells, and it does reduce the amount of germination. So we accept the hypothesis. But inside the tomatoes themselves, none of the seeds germinate. There is a bit more work to do yet! Report results We must now decide whether or not to report the results to other biologists. Someone else might decide to take the work further and try to isolate a particular chemical from the many in the juice to find exactly what is stopping them from growing inside the tomato itself.",

        "topic": "How did the scientific method disprove the idea of spontaneous generation?",
        "chunk_text": "What about the belief that rotting meat produces flies? How could you disprove that by using the scientific method? Well, in1668 an Italian biologist, Francesco Redi, did just that. Many scientists consider this to be the first true 'experiment'. He used wide-mouth jars containing meat. Some jars were left open to the air. Others were covered with a piece of gauze. After several days, maggots and then flies could be seen in the open jars, but none appeared in the closed jars. Redi hypothesised that only flies could produce more flies and predicted that, in his experiment, flies would be found in the open jars, but not in the covered jars. He maintained all the jars under the same conditions and so he controlled many variables. By choosing to cover some jars with gauze rather than an impermeable seal, he allowed air to enter all the jars - again he controlled a variable that could have affected the outcome of the experiment. His results matched his prediction and when other people tried the experiment, they too got the same results. Redi was able to conclude that flies cannot be produced from rotting meat. He also went on to say that it was unlikely that any form of spontaneous generation was possible. Most people accepted this for larger organisms, but, at round about this time, the microscope had been invented and the whole world of microbiology was opened up. Many people still believed that micro-organisms could arise by spontaneous generation. It took the work of Louis Pasteur to disprove this. In1859, Pasteur carried out experiments to show that the micro-organisms that caused wine and broth to go cloudy came from the air and were not made from the broth itself. He used special 'swan-necked flasks' like that shown in Figure1.4. Pasteur boiled broths in swan-necked flasks to kill any micro-organisms that might be in them. The boiling forced steam and air out of the flasks. When the boiling stopped and the broth cooled, air was sucked back into the flasks. Some contained a filter to prevent all solid particles from getting into the growth medium from the air. Others had no filter but, in these, the dust (and the micro-organisms) in the air settled in the lowest part of the neck of the flask. All the flasks were kept under the same conditions in Pasteur's laboratory. Pasteur found that the broths stayed clear for months. At the end of this time, he treated the flasks in one of three ways: He left some of them as they were. He broke the necks on some. He tilted others to allow the dust in the low part of the neck to mix with the broths. The broths in the second two groups of flasks turned cloudy (due to the presence of micro-organisms) within days. The broths in the first group remained clear. After this, people were forced to admit that spontaneous generation, even of micro-organisms, could not happen. One stage in the scientific method is to 'do background research'. Pasteur certainly did that. He knew that other scientists had tried to disprove spontaneous generation before him and he was able to draw on the results of their experiments and improve their technique.",

The factor that the scientist changes, or manipulates, is called the independent variable (or IV for short). The factor that the scientist measures to see if it changes when the IV is changed is called the dependent variable (or DV for short). The scientist will want to find out if changes in the independent variable produce changes in the dependent variable. In the example on pages5 and6, the independent variable was the presence or absence of tomato juice. The dependent variable was the number of tomato seeds germinating. To prove cause and effect - to prove that it is changes in the IV (and nothing else) that are causing changes in the DV - we must take all the steps we can to ensure that the experiment is a fair test. We must make sure that any other factors which could affect the results are the same for the different conditions we set up. In the tomato seed example, if one group of seeds had been at a higher temperature than the other group, this could have made them germinate faster. We wouldn't have known whether it was the tomato juice affecting the results or the temperature. Our experiment would not be valid. So we must keep constant anything other than the IV that might influence the results. These are controlled variables. In the tomato seed experiment, the controlled variables were: temperature lighting conditions number of seeds per dish, and volume of liquid added (water or tomato juice). Occasionally, there is a variable that might influence the results that you can't control. Such a variable is a confounding variable. This is because it 'confounds' the interpretation of the results. You couldn't be certain that it was the IV producing the changes in the DV because of the presence of the confounding variable. For example, if you measure the carbon dioxide uptake by wheat plants as the light intensity changes over the day, you cannot control the effect of change in temperature. It could be a confounding variable.",

For example, if you were timing a reaction that was likely to last a few minutes at most, the stop-clock would be the best choice.

To measure3.5 cm3 accurately, the pipette would be best. To measure200 cm3 you would use the measuring cylinder. This one holds100 cm3 and so you would have to fill it twice.

This makes it much more likely that we will be able to repeat our results. We can repeat it many times ourselves. This allows us to see, hopefully, a general pattern. It also allows us to: - spot any anomalous results and, if it is justified, to exclude these - calculate an average result, which is likely to be more representative than any individual result We can try not to use personal judgement. For example, if in a given experiment we have to wait until a solution turns a certain shade of red, one person's judgement will almost certainly differ from the next person's. There are ways around this: - We can have a 'standard' to compare our experiment to. In other words, something containing the chemical that is the exact colour we need it to be. This helps, but we must still make a judgement. - We can use a special apparatus called a colorimeter. This measures how much light passes through a liquid.

These journals are read by many other biologists who will want to understand their work and, perhaps, repeat it to check on the results. It is important, then, that the layout of the report is recognisable to everyone and understandable by everyone. So, there is a set way to lay out such a report. It is not always identical in every case, but there are certain 'rules' to follow. There must be: a title, which states clearly what is being investigated a hypothesis, stated clearly in terms of how the independent variable is expected to influence the dependent variable, often extended to a prediction for the particular experiment a clear description of the experimental procedure; this must be in such detail that anyone of the same level of understanding could easily replicate the procedure and it must include: - the apparatus used (a diagram of the assembled apparatus is useful) - details of any chemicals used; what volumes or concentrations or masses were used - details of any organisms used (for example, yeast, mice) - what strain and how many - details of any control experiments a full account of the results obtained; it is often helpful to summarise these (where appropriate) in graphs, charts and tables the conclusions that have been drawn from the results an evaluation of the procedure; this is an honest assessment of the limitations of the procedure that has been used, pointing out any unavoidable limitations and inaccuracies that arose an acknowledgement of the use of any other person's work; this is usually done by identifying by a number the place in the report where other work has been used, and then listing the sources at the end of the work So, for the tomato seed experiment, the report could look something like this: Section How it would be written Title An investigation into the effect of tomato juice on the germination of tomato seeds. Hypothesis A chemical in tomato juice inhibits the germination of seeds. Prediction Seeds covered in tomato juice will germinate less well than seeds covered in distilled water. Procedure30 tomatoes were blended for five minutes. The blended material was then filtered through some muslin and the liquid (juice) was collected. The seeds were extracted from the cellular material, which was then discarded. The juice was diluted with distilled water to give a total volume of550 cm3. The tomato seeds were washed in distilled water for30 seconds, to remove any chemicals from their surface. They were dried briefly on filter paper. 100 Petri dishes were prepared by placing a piece of filter paper in each. Each piece of filter paper had a0.5 cm grid drawn on it. 20 seeds were placed in each Petri dish on the intersections of the lines of the grid (to ensure even spacing in all dishes). 10 cm3 tomato juice was added to half of the Petri dishes and10 cm3 distilled water was added to the other half. All the dishes were placed in an incubator at a temperature of20 degrees C for four days. At the end of this time the number of successful germinations in each dish was recorded and means for each condition were calculated. If a radicle (root) of0.5 cm or more was present, the seed was said to have germinated. Results Out of1000 seeds sown in each condition, 668 germinated in the distilled water (13.36 per dish) and265 germinated in the tomato juice (5.3 per dish). Conclusion The hypothesis is accepted. The germination of the seeds in the tomato juice is much less successful than in distilled water. Some chemical in the tomato juice must therefore be inhibiting the germination. In tomato fruits, no seeds germinate, but it must be remembered that in our investigation, the juice had been diluted to give sufficient volume for50 replicates of the investigation. Evaluation There were no anomalous results. The germination of seeds in all of the dishes in the experimental condition (the tomato juice) was less successful than in the dishes in the control condition (distilled water). The experiment was not without limitations. It was only carried out for four days (to limit the development of fungal growth that might have interfered with germination). Had it been carried out for longer, the pattern may have been different. It was only carried out at one temperature; this may have influenced the experimental and control conditions differently. Repeating the investigation at a range of temperatures would help to clarify this. The judgement of germination (a radicle of0.5 cm length) was somewhat arbitrary, but it did overcome the problem of including in the count seeds that had merely swollen with water but not produced any growth. We are of the opinion that these limitations had only a minor effect on the validity and reliability of this experiment.

These include: microscopes dissecting equipment Petri dishes pipettes and syringes centrifuges measuring cylinders balances We have already considered measuring cylinders, pipettes and syringes when looking at the idea of 'accuracy' in scientific experiments. All these are used for measuring volumes, usually of liquids, but in some investigations they can be used to measure the volume of a gas. In this example, an upturned measuring cylinder is being used to collect oxygen gas produced when yeast converts hydrogen peroxide into water and oxygen. Some syringes are designed specifically as 'gas syringes' and could be used as an alternative way of collecting the oxygen in the above experiment. Balances are used for measuring mass. They come in a range of sizes and properties. Some can measure the mass of very heavy objects, but not with any great degree of precision. Others measure smaller masses to the nearest0.0001 g (one ten-thousandth of a gram). Sometimes biologists need to dissect specimens to find out what they are like inside. This need not always mean dissecting a whole organism. Quite often, students dissect organs, such as the heart or the kidney, to find out about their structure. Biologists may dissect owl pellets - these are pellets containing the parts of food that the owl has eaten and that cannot be digested and have been regurgitated. Dissecting these can give information about what the bird has been eating. Figure1.11 shows a standard dissecting kit containing a magnifying glass, scalpels, scissors, forceps (tweezers) and mounted needles. Figure1.12 shows a student dissecting a frog. The student is using a scalpel to cut away the skin and reveal the abdominal organs. These can then be removed and studied individually. Petri dishes are round dishes made from glass or from plastic. They are used in many different ways, but usually to culture some organisms. They are often filled with a 'jelly' called agar and used to culture bacteria. There are many different agars containing different balances of nutrients. Each type of agar can encourage the growth of different bacteria. By marking a grid on the surface of the Petri dish, biologists can estimate how much of the dish is covered by bacteria and then use this to estimate how fast the bacteria are growing. Petri dishes are also used to propagate or culture plants. The small 'plantlets' or 'explants' in figure1.14 have been grown on a special agar from just a few plant cells. They will grow roots and then shoots and leaves. When they are big enough, they will be transplanted into pots of soil or compost and grown into mature plants. Petri dishes can also be used to: show how effective different antibiotics are against certain types of bacteria show how well different concentrations of enzymes digest a substance As you know already from your study in grade9, microscopes are one of the most vital tools in a biology laboratory. There are two main types: optical microscopes that use beams of light to produce magnified images electron microscopes that use beams of electrons to produce magnified images You are unlikely ever to use an electron microscope, simply because of cost. Light microscopes vary from basic microscopes that can be used in the laboratory and even taken out and used in the field to very sophisticated microscopes that are linked to image-enhancing computer programs to produce all kinds of images that help to make the image clearer. Of course, biologists also use electron microscopes that give much higher magnifications and, importantly, much higher resolution, so that more detail can be seen. Transmission electron microscopes allow researchers to view the structure of cells in great detail. The transmission electron micrograph (TEM) of the cell from the leaf of a tobacco plant in figure1.18B shows six large chloroplasts, the vacuole of the cell and the nucleus and cytoplasm. Scanning electron microscopes do not see 'into' cells in the same way, but create images of the surface of a specimen by scanning it with a high-energy beam of electrons. Computer programming allows the different parts to be 'false coloured' for clearer interpretation. This is shown in the scanning electron micrograph (SEM) of the head of a monarch butterfly, figure1.18A. Centrifuges are used to separate solids from liquids where simple filtration is not adequate for the task. Some solid particles are very tiny and float around in a liquid, although they are not properly dissolved in the liquid. Centrifugation can separate these solid particles from the liquid without the need to filter. The mixture is placed in a 'centrifuge tube' and placed in the centrifuge. The centrifuge then spins the tubes at high speed. As the tubes spin, the gravitational forces on the solid particles force them to the bottom of the tube. Some centrifuges, called 'ultracentrifuges', can spin really fast and cause extremely light particles to fall to the bottom of the tube. These ultracentrifuges are used to separate the various components of animal and plant cells. Centrifugation is commonly used in hospitals for stool tests where the ability to separate particles quickly and clearly is very useful.",

Biology seeks to understand how all life functions - including life on other planets, should it exist. Biology attempts to give scientific answers to many questions that most people think are important. Some of these are listed below: Where did humans come from? Where did I come from? How do I work? How did all life begin? How is disease caused? How is AIDS caused? How can vaccines be developed against diseases like malaria and AIDS? What makes cancer cells different from ordinary cells? Will it ever be possible to grow a new kidney just for me? Will people one day live forever? What causes global warming? How can we solve problems of food shortage? Because biology is the science of life, biologists undertake all kinds of research. Some try to find possible biological explanations for other, non-scientific, aspects of life. Some try to find biological explanations for why some people: have a strong religious belief whilst others don't are record-breaking athletes, like Haile Gebrselassie and Meseret Defar, and others aren't have amazing musical talent, whilst others don't, or can write poetry, whilst others can't. Biologists also try to find out why organisms behave in the way that they do. When this is applied to humans, it is often called 'behavioural psychology', but many consider it to be a branch of biology. Some of these biologists believe that it will one day be possible to understand how all the nerve cells that make up the brain interact with each other to store memories, carry out problem-solving activities and learn as well as modify behaviour patterns. The study of biology has relevance in almost every aspect of life. It would take far too long to analyse all aspects of the relevance of biology. However, there are some which are undoubtedly of great importance. Biology and agriculture The world's population is growing at an alarming rate and this poses challenges to governments all over the world. The extra people all need homes, food and all the other services that are provided. Many biologists are addressing the problem of how to produce the extra food. However, they have another problem to consider, which is that global warming may alter the way in which crops grow. Many crops that now produce high yields in some countries will not do so if the current trends continue. Some countries will benefit, as they will find that their agricultural output will increase with global warming. There are many different estimates as to which countries will 'win' and which will 'lose'. So how can biologists help? They are carrying out research into how to produce crop plants that: will be adapted to the new conditions are capable of producing their crop quickly so that more than one crop can be obtained per year from a field are disease resistant are drought resistant This work involves the genetic modification of existing crop plants to give them the new characteristics that will enable them to be productive in the changed environment.",

        "topic": "Why is water so important to living things?",
        "chunk_text": "The very first cells on Earth evolved in water about3.5 billion years ago. Water has many properties that make it important to living things in a number of ways, such as: a place to live a transport medium a reactant in many chemical reactions a place for other reactions to take place water is a vital chemical constituent of living cells Water is a place to live in. Many organisms live in water. Plants and algae both live in water as do many different types of animals Water is transparent. This means that light can pass through the water and allow the plants and algae to photosynthesise. It also means that animals can see where they are going. However, water does not allow all light to pass through it and as we go deeper and deeper, less and less light penetrates. Different wavelengths of light penetrate to different depths. Red and indigo wavelengths are soon lost. Blue and green wavelengths penetrate deeper than others. Water has a high specific heat capacity. This means that it takes quite a lot of energy to heat water up. Water also loses heat quite slowly. This has the overall effect that water stays more or less the same temperature - particularly large masses of water, such as oceans and lakes. This is important as the functioning of enzymes in living cells is affected by temperature. Too hot or too cold and the enzymes do not function efficiently and the reactions in the cells controlled by the enzymes are not carried out efficiently. Ice is less dense than liquid water. It is unusual for the solid form of a substance to float on the liquid form of the same substance, but ice floats on water. This is because water expands when it freezes. So, in cold weather, water freezes from the top down. The ice on the surface then acts as an insulator and slows down the heat loss from the liquid water underneath. So life can continue in relatively warm water underneath the ice all through the cold weather. Water has a high latent heat of vaporisation. This means that it takes a lot of energy to turn liquid water into water vapour (or steam). In turn this means that water doesn't vaporise too easily and that ponds don't dry up too quickly in hot weather - and the organisms in the pond have a better chance of survival. This property is also important in temperature control. When we sweat, the energy needed to vaporise the sweat comes from our bodies. This heat is then lost from our bodies and so we cool down. If water vaporised easily, sweating wouldn't be as effective in controlling our body temperature. Water has a high surface tension. The water molecules in the main body of a mass of water are hydrogen-bonded to other water molecules on all sides. But at the surface, there is no hydrogen bonding above. So the 'pull' from the sides is stronger than it would otherwise be and the molecules at the surface are held together more strongly. This is why some animals can 'walk on water' and why others can attach themselves to the surface of the water and live just below the surface. The water strider in figure2.10 is just one example of an insect that is so light that the force of the surface tension of the water can support the weight of the insect. The mosquito larvae in figure2.11 hang from the surface of the water by their breathing tubes. The surface tension is sufficiently strong to hold their weight. Water is a good solvent for many substances Many organic and inorganic substances important to life dissolve in water, but don't dissolve either at all or as well in other liquids. Water is very versatile. Because these substances dissolve in water, they can be transported in a water-based transport medium. Biological mechanisms such as active transport, diffusion and facilitated diffusion move the substances into and out of the water (in the transport medium). In mammals, the plasma of blood is90% water. This is forced through the system of veins arteries and capillaries by the heart. In plants water carries dissolved minerals upwards from the roots to other parts of the plants in the xylem vessels. Water in the phloem tubes carries dissolved organic substances all over the plant. Water has the ideal viscosity for a transport medium. Viscosity is a measure of how fluid a liquid is - how easily it flows. If water were more viscous (less fluid) than it is - think of tar! - then the heart would not be able to move it through the blood vessels. Also, the water inside cells transports substances around the cell; if it were more viscous, it would damage the delicate organelles in the cells. If water were less viscous (more fluid) than it is, it would flow too easily and, inside cells, the organelles would not be supported. Similarly, in the circulatory system, a less viscous liquid would not move the blood cells around the system as efficiently.",

Turgid cells press against each other and this pressure helps to support the plant. If the cells lose water, the pressure decreases and so does the support. Water as a reactant. Many reactions in living things need water as a raw material. Photosynthesis - the process which begins the process of energy transfer between living things - requires water as one of its reactants. No water, no photosynthesis. Water is also involved in digesting large food molecules into smaller ones. Reactions that use water to split large molecules are called hydrolysis reactions. Hydro = water; lysis = splitting. Water molecules are used to split large food molecules into smaller ones that can be absorbed into the bloodstream. Water is also involved in other reactions. For example, it is involved in reactions with carbon dioxide in red blood cells that are important in the transport of carbon dioxide around the body as hydrogen carbonate ions. Water as a medium for chemical reactions. Cells function because of the many chemical reactions that are continually taking place in them. Many of these take place on the membrane systems of the cell, but others take place in the liquid 'cytosol' of the cytoplasm. Also, many of the reactions of photosynthesis and respiration take place in the liquid inner regions of chloroplasts and mitochondria. Water is an ideal medium for these reactions - for some of the reasons already discussed: It can dissolve many substances - the reactions will only take place effectively in solution. It has a low viscosity - the particles can move around and come easily into contact with each other. So, we can see that, without water, life as we know could not possibly exist. Water is just too important.",

RNA or RiboNucleic Acid - RNA is a nucleic acid found both in the nucleus and the cytoplasm. Different types of RNA are involved in allowing a specific gene (DNA) to produce the protein it codes for.

We shall study the structure and functioning of nucleic acids in more detail in grade12, but they are very important biological molecules, so we will just outline their structure and functions now. Both types of nucleic acids are made from structures called nucleotides. All nucleotides have the same basic structure. All nucleotides have the same three components: a phosphate group a pentose sugar (deoxyribose in DNA nucleotides and ribose in RNA nucleotides), and one of four nitrogenous bases - Adenine, Cytosine, Guanine and either Thymine (DNA) or Uracil (RNA).

Second, within that very complex structure is a region called the active site. This is the part of the enzyme molecule that binds with its substrate so that the enzyme can catalyse the chemical reaction. The active site of an enzyme is shaped to allow: binding with a particular substrate and that substrate only, and binding in such a way that the reaction can take place requiring less energy than if the enzyme was not present. We can use the example of the enzyme sucrase catalysing the hydrolysis of sucrose substrate into glucose and fructose to illustrate this. We are now in a position where we can define more precisely what we mean when we are talking about an enzyme: An enzyme is a globular protein with a uniquely shaped active site; it acts as a biological catalyst for a specific reaction, but remains unaltered by the reaction.",

For example, polymerase (aids in polymerisation - joining similar units together), dehydrogenase (removal of hydrogen atoms or ions). Some enzymes have been named based on the source from which they were first identified. For example, papayin from papaya. Others are named according to where they act. For example, intestinal protease acts on proteins in the intestine. The names of some enzymes end with 'in', indicating that they are basically proteins. For example, pepsin, trypsin, etc. These enzymes usually have alternative names that tell you rather more about them. For example, the alternative name for pepsin is gastric protease. This tells you that it acts on proteins and it does so in the stomach. Because of the varied ways in which enzymes had been named, biologists at the Enzyme Commission decided to produce a systematic way of naming enzymes, based on the ways in which the enzymes act.

Unknowingly, they used enzymes (in yeast) to make bread and beer. These are almost certainly the first uses of 'enzyme technology'. Yeast is a unicellular fungus that ferments carbohydrates to produce carbon dioxide and alcohol. The enzymes in yeast control the reactions of fermentation. We still use yeast to brew alcoholic drinks, such as tella, and to bake breads, such as injera. Both these Ethiopian products are often made at home, as well as professionally. When dough is baked to produce the bread, the tiny amount of alcohol formed is lost and the carbon dioxide expands to make the dough 'rise' to form a loaf of bread. When beer is brewed, it is the carbon dioxide that is lost and the alcohol remains! However, enzyme technology is now very big business. Enzymes are used in many industries. They are used to produce washing powders - the enzymes in the washing powders digest the stains in the clothes. 'Stone-washed' denim jeans are now given their stone- washed look by the action of enzymes. Table3.3 shows just a few of the areas where enzyme technology is used. One of the appeals of using enzymes in industry is that they allow the reactions involved in the processes to be carried out at much lower temperatures. This means less energy (and therefore less money) is spent on heating the reactants. Because less heating is required, less carbon dioxide is produced and this can benefit the environment as carbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas and its accumulation in the atmosphere can lead to global warming.",

Under normal conditions, very few molecules of A and B have sufficient kinetic energy to 'climb the activation energy hill', so the reaction proceeds slowly. A catalyst lowers the activation energy required for the reaction. More reactant molecules can meet this lower energy requirement and so the reaction proceeds more quickly.

One egg cannot sit inside another egg because the shapes are the same. The complementary substrate molecule binds with the active site of the enzyme to form the enzyme-substrate complex. The complex causes the reactants to enter a transition state in which the activation energy of the reaction is lowered. The reaction takes place and the products formed are released. The lock-and-key model of enzyme action suggests that the enzyme lowers the activation energy by providing an alternative pathway for the reaction. For example: Non-catalysed pathway: Reactant A + Reactant B yields Product AB Enzyme-catalysed pathway: Reactant A + Reactant B + enzyme yields Intermediate yields Product AB + enzyme This model sees the enzyme-substrate complex as the intermediate, which is part of a pathway that requires less energy than the normal pathway.

In the transition state, bonds in the reactants are put under strain and break more easily and rejoin with other bonds to form the products. The products formed leave the active site. Most biologists now prefer the induced-fit model over the lock- and-key model as it explains other properties of enzymes, such as enzyme inhibition, in a more complete manner than the lock-and- key model. The rate of a chemical reaction is the rate at which reactants are converted into products. In the case of an enzyme-controlled reaction, this is determined by how many molecules of substrate bind with enzyme molecules to form enzyme-substrate complexes. The number of molecules of reactants that form enzyme-substrate complexes with each molecule of an enzyme, per second, is the turnover rate of the enzyme.",

The two parts are the apoenzyme and the cofactor. We can define these in the following way: Apoenzyme - a protein that combines with a cofactor, to form an active enzyme. The protein is inactive on its own. Cofactor - a small non-protein particle essential for the activity of some enzymes. The cofactor combines with the apoenzyme to produce an active enzyme. Where an active enzyme molecule comprises an apoenzyme and a cofactor, the whole is sometimes referred to as the holoenzyme. Cofactors include: coenzymes mineral ions Coenzymes are organic molecules and many are derived from vitamins. They bind with the enzyme to give catalytic activity. Some enzymes can only function in the presence of certain mineral ions. These bind loosely with the enzyme to give it its catalytic activity.",

This increases the probability that a substrate particle will collide with an enzyme molecule. Particles within a molecule vibrate more energetically. This puts strain on the bonds that hold the atoms in place. Bonds begin to break and, in the case of an enzyme, the shape of the molecule, and the active site in particular, begin to change. The enzyme begins to lose its tertiary structure (remember it is a protein) and denature. The activity of an enzyme at a given temperature is a balance between these two effects. If the raised temperature results in little denaturation but a greatly increased number of collisions, the activity of the enzyme will increase. If the higher temperature causes significant denaturation then, despite the extra collisions, the activity of the enzyme will probably decrease. The temperature at which the two effects just balance each other is the optimum temperature for that enzyme. Any further increase in temperature will cause increased denaturation that will outweigh the effects of extra collisions. A decrease in temperature means that fewer collisions will occur. Note that the graph is not symmetrical. Above the optimum temperature, the enzyme denatures very quickly to the point at which the shape of the active site has changed so much that an enzyme-substrate complex cannot form. At this point the reaction rate is zero.",

The majority of enzymes in most mammals function most efficiently within the pH range6.0-8.0, although the optimum pH of pepsin (an enzyme found in the stomach) is between pH1.0 and pH3.0. Significant changes in pH can affect an enzyme molecule by: breaking ionic bonds that hold the tertiary structure in place; this leads to denaturation of the enzyme molecule altering the charge on some of the amino acids that form the active site; this makes it more difficult for substrate molecules to bind These effects occur if the pH becomes either more acidic or more alkaline.",

The overall effect on the rate of reaction depends on the relative concentrations of substrate and inhibitor molecules. Each molecule of competitive inhibitor can inhibit (temporarily) one enzyme molecule - but only if it can collide with the enzyme molecule and bind with the active site. To do this, it must compete with the substrate molecules for the active site - hence the name, competitive inhibitor.

Because two lenses are used, compound microscopes are capable of higher magnifications than simple microscopes, which use only one lens. The second lens (the eyepiece) magnifies the already magnified image produced by the objective lens. However, it also magnifies any 'aberrations' or faults in the image. So if the lenses are not well made, the final image, at high magnifications, will be blurred. The first compound microscope was made in1595 by the Dutch scientist, Zaccharias Jansen. 1824 The French biologist Rene Dutrochet concludes that all organisms are composed of cells. This follows many years work in which he also discovers: the stomata in the epidermis of leaves the process of osmosis chlorophyll is needed for photosynthesis to occur respiration occurs in both animals and plants In many ways, Dutrochet is the man who first states the cell theory by recognising that all organisms are made of cells and that 'all growth occurs because of the increase in volume of cells or by the addition of more little cells'. 1839 Matthias Schleiden and Theodor Schwann put forward the first clearly stated cell theory. It states that: the cell is the unit of structure, physiology and organisation in living things the cell retains a dual existence as: - a distinct entity, and - a 'building block' in the formation of organisms cells form by free-cell formation (spontaneous generation) Although we still accept the first two ideas, the final idea of spontaneous generation has now been proved false. 1858 Rudolf Virchow, a German doctor who develops many surgical techniques and promotes several fields of modern medicine, declares that: 'Omnis cellula e cellula', which means that a cell can only arise from another cell like it. With this he completes the first accepted version of the cell theory: all organisms are made up of one or more cells all cells come from pre-existing cells the cell is the unit of structure, physiology and organisation in living things the cell retains a dual existence as a distinct entity and a building block in the construction of organisms Today, this has been modified and extended in the light of our increased knowledge of genetics and cell biology and now reads: all known living things are made up of cells the cell is a structural and functional unit of all living things all cells come from pre-existing cells by division (there is no spontaneous generation of cells) cells contain hereditary information which is passed from cell to cell during cell division all cells have basically the same chemical composition all energy flow (the metabolism and biochemistry of life) occurs within cells Besides these major steps in the development of a cell theory, there have been other developments in the study of cell biology.

So we use other, smaller units to measure the size of cells and molecules. These smaller units give us numbers that are more convenient to work with. There are three smaller units commonly used: millimetres (mm) - 1/1000 of a metre micrometres (umm) - 1/1000 of a millimetre, and1/1 000 000 of a metre nanometres (nm) - 1/1000 of a micrometre, 1/1 000 000 of a millimetre, and1/1000 000 000 of a metre We can convert the units from one to another as shown below: times1000 times1000 times1000 m mm umm nm divided by1000 divided by1000 divided by1000 To convert a larger unit to the next smaller unit, multiply by1000: For example, convert3.5 mm to umm. 3.5 mm = 3.5 times1000 = 3500 umm To convert a smaller unit to the next larger unit, divide by1000: For example, convert87 nm to umm. 87 divided by1000 = 0.087 umm So, our red blood cell that was0.000007 m in diameter is0.007 mm or7 umm in diameter. This is a much more comprehensible number. Most cells fall within a much narrower range of sizes than the chicken's egg and the smallest bacterium. As you can see from figure4.9, the length of most animal and plant cells fall within a range of10 umm to100 umm. Most bacteria are about one-tenth of this length.

Look at figure4.13. It shows three cubic 'cells' of different sizes. The linear dimensions double from the first cell to the second and double again from the second cell to the third.

If it can't release enough energy, these other processes will slow down and the cell may die. In order to respire, the cell needs oxygen, which enters through the surface of the cell. The volume determines how much activity there is in a cell. A large cell will have more processes happening, or at least the same processes happening faster, than a smaller cell. The amount of energy that must be released in respiration is therefore decided largely by the volume. The amount of oxygen that can be delivered into the cell is decided largely by how much 'surface' there is, since it is through the surface of the cell that the oxygen enters. A large surface-area-to-volume ratio means that it is likely that the surface will be able to supply the oxygen demands of the cell. But as cells increase in size, the volume increases faster than the surface area and the surface-area-to-volume ratio decreases.

Without any direct observational evidence to assist them (the very first electron microscopes were only just being built and they could not reveal membrane structure) Davson and Danielli suggested a kind of 'sandwich' of protein and phospholipid. This was based on what they knew of the proportions of the two substances in the membrane. The protein was to form the 'bread' of the sandwich with the phospholipid forming the 'filling'. In1954 they proposed a revised model in which they included protein-lined pores. Figure4.20 shows the Davson-Danielli models of1935 and1954. As more and more evidence accumulated about how molecules moved across membranes, it became clear that the Davson-Danielli model could not adequately explain all the new evidence. The idea model therefore had to be rejected. In1972, Singer and Nicholson proposed a totally different arrangement of the phospholipids and proteins in the plasma membrane. They retained the idea of a phospholipid bilayer, but rejected the sandwich arrangement. Instead, they suggested that proteins were 'studded' into the bilayer at different points. They also suggested that the arrangement was not static, but was fluid and constantly changing. Figure4.21 shows the difference between the Davson-Danielli model and the original fluid mosaic model. As our understanding of processes that occur at the plasma membrane has increased and we have learned more of cell structure and function, the fluid mosaic model has become more sophisticated. Our current idea of membrane structure still assumes this fluid-mosaic nature, but there is now much more detail to the model, as figure4.22 shows. The key features of the model as we currently understand it are: The phospholipid bilayer as the basis for the membrane Integral proteins (also known as intrinsic proteins and trans-membrane proteins) that span the membrane. Some of these proteins play an important role in moving substances across the membrane. There are three main types of these transport proteins: - channel proteins - these proteins have a channel through them along which a specific ion can pass; there are different channel proteins for different ions - carrier proteins - these proteins act in a more sophisticated way to move larger molecules through the membrane by facilitated diffusion or active transport; the ones involved in active transport are often referred to as pumps - peripheral proteins (also known as extrinsic proteins) that span only one layer (or sometimes less) of the membrane. They have a range of functions; some are enzymes, others anchor integral proteins to the cytoskeleton Glycoproteins and glycolipids - protein and lipid molecules that have carbohydrate chains attached to them and often serve as signals to other cells. They also act as receptor sites for hormones and drugs. The carbohydrate component of each can be cell-specific and so allow identification of the cell by the immune system.

If particles are, for some reason, concentrated in a small area, they will move in such a way that the particles 'spread out' and occupy all the space that is available to them. This is a result of random particular motion. Diffusion need not involve a membrane. When particles diffuse across a plasma membrane, there must be a concentration difference between the two sides of the membrane (a concentration gradient) to drive the process. As diffusion proceeds, the high concentration will decrease and the low concentration will increase until the two concentrations are the same. At this point there will be no further net diffusion. This means that although particles will still move across the membrane, they will move equally in both directions, so there will be no overall effect. We say that the concentrations are in equilibrium. Figures4.24 and4.25 show this. The rate at which diffusion across a membrane takes place is influenced by: the concentration gradient - a bigger difference in concentration results in faster diffusion than a smaller gradient the thickness of the membrane - as all plasma membranes are the same thickness, this is not really an issue when considering diffusion into and out of cells, but for other situations where particles must cross some kind of barrier, a shorter distance results in faster diffusion the surface area of the membrane - clearly if there is more membrane where diffusion can take place, diffusion will happen faster These features are all related in an equation called Fick's law of diffusion: Rate of diffusion is proportional to Surface area of membrane times Concentration difference Diffusion distance The rate of diffusion is also influenced by temperature. Diffusion occurs faster at higher temperatures because the particles have more kinetic energy and so move faster.",

Figure4.26A shows facilitated diffusion of an ion through an ion pore. Figure4.26B shows a carrier protein moving particles across a membrane. Note in both cases that the particles are moving from a high concentration to a low concentration (as with simple diffusion). However, also note that whilst the ions can simply move straight through the ion pore of a channel protein, the carrier protein must undergo a conformational change (change in shape) to move particles through the membrane. The rate of facilitated diffusion is affected by the same factors that affect simple diffusion with the exception that it is not the actual surface area of the membrane that determines the rate, but the number of carrier proteins (or channel proteins) present.",

The large nucleus requires a relatively low centrifuge speed to make it settle out; the much smaller ribosomes require a much higher speed. The technique is carried out as follows: The cell sample is stored in a suspension that is: - buffered - the neutral pH prevents damage to the structure of proteins, including enzymes - isotonic (of equal water potential) - this prevents osmotic water gain or loss by the organelles; gaining too much water could rupture the organelles - cool - this reduces the overall activity of enzymes released later in the procedure The cells are homogenised in a blender and filtered to remove debris. The homogenised sample is placed in an ultracentrifuge and spun at low speed. The nuclei settle out, forming a pellet. The supernatant (the suspension containing the remaining organelles) is spun at a higher speed - chloroplasts settle out (if plant tissue is used). The supernatant is spun at a higher speed still - mitochondria settle out. The process is repeated at ever higher speeds until all the organelles have been separated.

It does not take place inside the mitochondria because: the glucose molecule cannot diffuse through the mitochondrial membranes (it is a medium-sized molecule and is not lipid soluble), and there are no carrier proteins to transport the glucose molecule across the membranes. Glycolysis (literally 'glucose splitting') results in glucose being converted into a smaller molecule containing only three carbon atoms - pyruvate. Pyruvate can enter the mitochondria and so all the other stages take place inside the mitochondrion. In the link reaction, pyruvate is then converted into a two-carbon compound that enters into a cycle of reactions - the Krebs cycle (named after Sir Hans Krebs who discovered the reactions involved). Both these stages take place in the fluid matrix of a mitochondrion. In all three stages (glycolysis, the link reaction and Krebs cycle), hydrogen atoms are transferred to NAD to produce reduced NAD. The Krebs cycle also produces reduced FAD. These molecules later release their hydrogen atoms as protons (hydrogen ions) and electrons in the final stage of aerobic respiration. The electrons pass along a series of molecules called an electron transport chain. The protons are used in the chemiosmotic synthesis of ATP as they spin the rotor of the ATP synthase enzyme located in the inner membrane of the mitochondrion. Eventually, the protons (hydrogen ions) and electrons will combine with oxygen to form water. Without the oxygen, this cannot happen as there is nothing at the end of the electron transport chain to accept the electrons. The electron transport chain grinds to a halt and so does the production of ATP by ATP synthase. Because it is oxygen-dependent, this method of production of ATP is called oxidative phosphorylation. The link reaction, Krebs cycle and the reactions of the electron transport chain all depend on the presence of oxygen. None of these occurs in anaerobic respiration.

This proton gradient results in protons diffusing through the ATP synthase molecule (down the concentration gradient) making the synthase rotor 'spin' and produce ATP from ADP and P. The diffusion of i hydrogen ions through the ATP synthase is chemiosmosis. The oxidation of one molecule of reduced NAD results in six protons passing through ATP synthase and so leads to the synthesis of three molecules of ATP. The oxidation of one molecule of reduced FAD results in four protons passing through ATP synthase and so leads to the synthesis of just two molecules of ATP. By adding up the number of molecules of ATP produced, the model of aerobic respiration we have discussed predicts that there will be a net yield of38 molecules of ATP per molecule of glucose. A summary of the overall reaction of the electron transport system: 6 reduced NAD (from Krebs' cycle) + 2 reduced NAD (from glycolysis) + 2 reduced FAD (from Krebs' cycle) + 30 ADP + 30 Pi - 2ATP (used in proton pumps) yields36 ATP + 8 NAD + 2FAD In practice, this is not achieved because some energy (the equivalent of just over two molecules of ATP) is used to drive the proton pumps. The actual yield is about36 molecules of ATP per molecule of glucose. Figure5.15 summarises the production of ATP in aerobic respiration.

So, over time, there will be a reduction in volume inside the respirometer. Figure5.16 shows the respirometer placed under water. As the volume inside the respirometer decreases, water will enter the pipette. The volume of water entering is equal to the volume of oxygen being used up. We can use this to measure the rate of respiration by measuring how much oxygen is used in a set period of time (say10 minutes) then working out a rate per minute.",

As a result, the electron transport chain comes to a halt. No protons are pumped and the action of ATP synthase also stops. There is a further 'knock-on' effect. If the electron transport chain does not function, NAD is not regenerated from reduced NAD and FAD is not regenerated from reduced FAD. Very quickly, the Krebs cycle and the link reaction come to a halt as both NAD and FAD are required in their oxidised forms for the Krebs cycle to function. NAD is also required in the link reaction and so this comes to a halt also. However, glycolysis can continue even though it also requires NAD. This is because the reduced NAD formed during glycolysis can be regenerated under anaerobic conditions by converting the pyruvate into another product in a reduction reaction. Reduced NAD supplies the hydrogen for this reduction and becomes oxidised itself. It is therefore regenerated and can be used again in glycolysis.

The conditions created in the chloroplast cause the following reaction to occur: 2H O yields O + 4H+ + 4e- This light-dependent splitting of water is called photolysis. The electrons replace those lost from the chlorophyll molecule. 3. The primary electron acceptor passes the electrons to the next molecule in an electron transport chain (plastoquinone or 'Pq'). The electrons then pass along a series of cytochromes (similar to those in the mitochondrial electron transport chain) and finally to plastocyanin (Pc) - the last carrier in the chain. The electrons lose energy as they are passed from one carrier to the next. 4. One of the molecules in the cytochromes complex is a proton (hydrogen ion) pump. As electrons are transferred to and then transferred from this molecule, the energy they lose powers the pump which moves protons from the stroma of the chloroplast to the space inside the thylakoid. This leads to an accumulation of protons inside the thylakoid, which drives the chemiosmotic synthesis of ATP. 5. Electrons in chlorophyll molecules in photosystem I are excited (as this photosystem absorbs photons of light) and escape from the molecule. They are replaced by the electrons that have passed down the electron transport chain from photosystem II. 6. The electrons then pass along a second electron transport chain involving ferredoxin (Fd) and NADP reductase.

A photosynthetic unit is a unit of pigments, electron carriers and ATP synthase that is capable of carrying out all the reactions in the light-dependent stage of photosynthesis. The formation of ATP in the way described above is called non-cyclic photophosphorylation. This is because: the phosphorylation (formation of ATP) is light-dependent the electrons lost from the chlorophyll are not recycled in any way Plants sometimes generate ATP by cyclic photophosphorylation. In cyclic photophosphorylation, only photosystem I is used. No oxygen and no reduced NADP are formed. shows this system. Here, you can see that electrons lost from the chlorophyll molecule are returned to it. Hence the name 'cyclic'. This process usually only happens when sugars cannot be synthesised for some reason - such as lack of carbon dioxide. In cyclic and non-cyclic photophosphorylation, ATP is produced because: there is an accumulation of protons (hydrogen ions) in the interior of a thylakoid this creates a concentration gradient between the thylakoid interior and the stroma of the chloroplast protons move down this concentration gradient, through ATP synthase, causing the rotor to spin, just as in mitochondria during respiration",

They comprise a complex cycle of reactions that involves the addition of carbon dioxide to a pre- existing five-carbon molecule (a molecule containing five carbon atoms) within the chloroplast. The resulting molecules are modified to regenerate the original molecule whilst, at the same time, synthesising glucose. The sequence of reactions was discovered by Melvin Calvin, an American biologist. Because of his work, the light-independent reactions are also referred to as the Calvin cycle. In the1950s Melvin Calvin experimented with unicellular algae called Chlorella by exposing them to radioactive carbon dioxide. After different periods of time, the algae were killed and the chemicals in the algae that contained radioactive carbon (which must have come from the carbon dioxide) were identified using two-dimensional chromatography. As time passes more compounds contain the radioactive carbon. By refining the experiment and using shorter and shorter intervals, Calvin identified the first stable compound to be formed as a compound containing three carbon atoms called glycerate phosphate (GP). The main stages of the light-independent reactions are: carbon dioxide reacts with ribulose bisphosphate (RuBP) - a five-carbon compound in the stroma; the reaction is catalysed by the enzyme Rubisco. two molecules of the three-carbon compound GP are formed from this reaction as shows each molecule of GP is converted to TP (triose phosphate - another three-carbon compound); this is a reduction reaction using hydrogen ions from reduced NADP and energy from ATP some of the TP formed is used to regenerate the RuBP (ATP is again required) whilst some is used to form glucose and other useful organic compounds summarises the light-independent reactions of photosynthesis.

On a warm, cloudy day in summer, light intensity is likely to limit the rate. On a warm, sunny day in summer, it could well be the concentration of carbon dioxide.

The spongy mesophyll has air spaces that allow easy diffusion of carbon dioxide and oxygen between the palisade layer and the stomata. shows the structure of the leaf of a C3 plant. However, plants in the tropics have a problem. Here, it can be very hot and the leaves close their stomata to minimise water loss. When C3 plants do this, the concentration of carbon dioxide in the leaves falls and the enzyme Rubisco starts to behave in an unusual way. In the low concentrations of carbon dioxide, Rubisco binds with oxygen, not carbon dioxide. This means that RuBP is oxidised to one molecule of GP (not two) and a molecule of phosphoglycolate. In addition, carbon dioxide is produced in the process. The process is called photorespiration because it involves oxidation of carbon. Rubisco Ribulose bisphosphate + oxygen GP + phosphoglycolate The one molecule of GP formed in photorespiration can re-enter the Calvin cycle, but the phosphoglycolate must be converted into GP for use in the Calvin cycle by a complex series of reactions. These reactions (involving a chloroplast, an organelle called a peroxisome and a mitochondrion) are summarised in. It is not necessary to try to remember all these reactions. Instead, think of the two phases of photorespiration: 1. Rubisco catalyses a reaction between oxygen and RuBP to form one molecule of GP (not two) and one molecule of phosphoglycolate. 2. The phosphoglycolate is converted to GP in reactions in the chloroplast, peroxisome and mitochondrion. Photorespiration reduces the efficiency of photosynthesis for several reasons, including: the carbon is oxidised, which is the reverse of photosynthesis - the reduction of carbon to carbohydrate the ribulose bisphosphate must be resynthesised and the phosphoglycolate removed ATP is used in the resynthesis of RuBP.",

The light-dependent reactions are the same as in the C3 plants, but there is a difference in how glucose is synthesised in the light-independent reactions. First, look at the structure of the leaf of a C4 plant in. The structure is essentially similar to that of a C3 plant, but there is one important difference. The cells of the bundle sheath contain chloroplasts, which they don't in C3 plants. Having no thylakoids means that the light-dependent reactions cannot occur here and so oxygen is not produced in these chloroplasts. This helps to prevent photorespiration and allows the Calvin cycle to take place in these cells. The light-dependent reactions in the C4 pathway also involve a set of reactions not found in C3 plants. These reactions take place in the mesophyll cells, which have chloroplasts with thylakoids and so can carry out the light-dependent reactions. However, they do not have the enzymes to catalyse the reactions of the Calvin cycle. Instead, the following reactions take place: 1. Carbon dioxide reacts with a C3 compound called PEP to form the C4 compound oxaloacetate. This is catalysed by the enzyme PEP carboxylase. 2. Oxaloacetate is converted into another C4 compound (malate), which then passes from the mesophyll cell into a bundle sheath cell.",
