        "chunk_text": "Table 1.1 outlines how a biologist would follow the scientific method using the example of tomato seed germination. The process begins by asking a question, such as why tomato seeds don't grow inside tomatoes. Next, the biologist would do background research by checking scientific sources to discover existing knowledge, like the existence of plant growth regulators. This leads to constructing a testable hypothesis, for instance, that chemicals in tomatoes prevent seeds from growing whilst they are still in the tomatoes themselves, predicting that seeds covered in tomato juice will not germinate as well as seeds covered in water. The design and execution of an experiment involves blending and filtering tomatoes to obtain juice, washing seeds, then comparing the germination of 20 seeds covered in tomato juice versus 20 seeds covered in the same volume of distilled water (acting as a control group), keeping conditions like temperature and lighting constant, leaving them for four days, checking germination numbers, and repeating the experiment 50 times. For analyzing results and drawing conclusions, an experiment might show that out of 1000 seeds, 668 germinated in distilled water compared to only 265 in tomato juice, indicating a chemical in the juice (not cells, as they were filtered) affects germination. Based on this, the biologist can accept or reject the hypothesis, noting that while the juice reduces germination supporting the hypothesis, further work is needed since no seeds germinate inside actual tomatoes. Finally, the biologist reports results to the scientific community, potentially leading to further research to isolate the specific chemical.",

In terms of size, DNA is huge, which allows it to carry the code for many different proteins in its genes. In contrast, RNA is much smaller, needing only to code for one protein, and its small size enables it to move out of the nucleus. Regarding stability, DNA is very stable, ensuring that genes remain consistent across generations. Conversely, RNA is less stable and is degraded quite quickly, thus not continuously coding for a protein. Finally, DNA consists of two strands, which facilitates the coding of genes and replication during cell division, while RNA is single-stranded and does not replicate.",

The fourth class, isomerases, mediates changes in the molecular form of a substrate, including phosphohexoisomerase and fumerase. Lyases, the fifth class, involve the nonhydrolytic removal or addition of a group to a substrate, as seen in decarboxylases and aldolases.

In the dairy sector, biochymosin is used for cheese production to overcome the limited supply of natural rennet from calves' livers, while lactase produces lactose-free milk, reducing cramps for lactose-intolerant individuals. Detergents utilize proteases, lipases, and amylases in biological washing powders to efficiently remove many biological stains at low temperatures, saving energy; these enzymes also remove food particles in dishwasher detergents at lower temperatures, requiring fewer bleaching products. In textiles, proteases and lipases remove hair and degrease animal hides faster than traditional methods, and cellulase is used to 'bio-polish' cotton fabrics for a smoother, glossier finish and to 'bio-stone' denim for the stone-washed effect more easily. Food processing benefits from pectinase to clarify fruit juice and invertase to produce liquid-centre chocolates by liquefying sucrose paste. The pulp and paper industry employs amylases for starch conversion, reducing starch quantity and improving paper quality; xylanase enzymes for pre-bleaching pulp, yielding whiter paper; and esterases to control 'stickies' that would otherwise clog machinery and reduce paper quality. In medicine, glucose oxidase in Clinistix strips allows for easy diagnosis of diabetes through urine testing, and testing for high levels of liver enzymes confirms liver damage. Pulmozyme is used to treat cystic fibrosis by reducing mucus viscosity. Finally, in the pharmaceutical sector, streptokinase dissolves clots in heart-attack patients, restoring blood supply to heart muscle, and enzymes control the production of abacavir sulphate, an important anti-AIDS drug.",

Later developments include Kolliker describing mitochondria in 1857, Virchow stating 'omnis cellula e cellula' in 1858, Miescher isolating DNA in 1869, and Fleming describing chromosome behaviour during mitosis in 1879.

A key distinction is the nucleus: prokaryotic cells lack a membrane-bound nucleus, whereas eukaryotic cells possess a nucleus surrounded by a nuclear envelope. Regarding DNA, prokaryotic cells have it in a continuous loop not associated with protein, while eukaryotic cells have linear DNA associated with histone proteins in chromosomes. Mitochondria are absent in prokaryotic cells but present in eukaryotic cells. Chloroplasts are absent in prokaryotic cells, though some can photosynthesize with a kind of chlorophyll, while they are present in some eukaryotic cells like plant and algal cells. Ribosomes are present in both, but are smaller (70S) in prokaryotic cells and larger (80S) in eukaryotic cells. Finally, a cell wall is always present in prokaryotic cells, typically made from peptidoglycan and not cellulose, whereas in eukaryotic cells, it is present in plant, algal, and fungal cells, made from cellulose in plants, and various materials in others.",

Between 1910 and 1920, evidence mounted for phospholipids in the membrane, leading E. Gorter and G. Grendel to suggest a phospholipid bilayer in 1925. By 1935, Davson and Danielli, knowing proteins are also present, suggested a 'sandwich' model. In 1959, J. D. Robertson developed the unit membrane model, based on electron microscope evidence, suggesting all membranes are fundamentally alike. The current and widely accepted fluid mosaic model of membrane structure was proposed in 1972 by S. J. Singer and G. L. Nicholson.",

Facilitated diffusion also involves particles moving from a high to a low concentration, but through an ion pore or carrier protein. Osmosis is the movement of water molecules from a high water potential to a lower one across a partially permeable membrane. In contrast, active processes require energy from the cell's metabolism in the form of ATP. These include active transport, where particles move from a low to a higher concentration using a carrier protein or pump. Endocytosis is a process where large particles are engulfed by the plasma membrane forming a vesicle through invagination. Conversely, exocytosis involves the secretion of large particles by a vesicle merging with the plasma membrane to release its substance.",
